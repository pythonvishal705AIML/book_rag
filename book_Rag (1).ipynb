There are, of course, innumerable books on the ad-\\nvanced mathematics and strategies utilized by institutional traders\\nin this arena.

Aspiring independent (“retail”) traders who are looking to start\\na quantitative trading business.\\n2. Students of ﬁnance or other technical disciplines (at the un-\\ndergraduate or MBA level) who aspire to become quantitative\\ntraders and portfolio managers at major institutions.\\nCan these two very different groups of readers beneﬁt from the\\nsame set of knowledge and skills? Is there anything common be-\\ntween managing a $100 million portfolio and managing a $100,000\\nportfolio? My contention is that it is much more logical and sen-\\nsible for someone to become a proﬁtable $100,000 trader before\\nxi'),\n",

This can be shown to be\\ntrue on many fronts.\\nMany legendary quantitative hedge fund managers such as Dr.\\nEdward Thorp of the former Princeton-Newport Partners (Pound-\\nstone, 2005) and Dr. Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies Corp.\\n(Lux, 2000) started their careers trading their own money. They did\\nnot begin as portfolio managers for investment banks and hedge\\nfunds before starting their own fund management business. Of\\ncourse, there are also plenty of counterexamples, but clearly this\\nis a possible route to riches as well as intellectual accomplishment,\\nand for someone with an entrepreneurial bent, a preferred route.\\nEven if your goal is to become an institutional trader, it is still\\nworthwhile to start your own trading business as a ﬁrst step. Physi-\\ncists and mathematicians are now swarming Wall Street. Few peo-\\nple on the Street are impressed by a mere PhD from a prestigious\\nuniversity anymore. What is the surest way to get through the door\\nof the top banks and funds? To show that you have a systematic\\nway to proﬁts—in other words, a track record. Quite apart from\\nserving as a stepping stone to a lucrative career in big institutions,\\nhaving a proﬁtable track record as an independent trader is an in-\\nvaluable experience in itself. The experience forces you to focus on\\nsimple but proﬁtable strategies, and not get sidetracked by overly\\ntheoretical or sophisticated theories. It also forces you to focus\\non the nitty-gritty of quantitative trading that you won’t learn from\\nmost books: things such as how to build an order entry system that\\ndoesn’t cost $10,000 of programming resource.

Yes, you do need to possess some basic knowledge\\nof statistics, such as how to calculate averages, standard deviations,\\nor how to ﬁt a straight line through a set of data points. Yes, you\\nalso need to have some basic familiarity with Excel. But what you\\ndon’t need is any advanced knowledge of stochastic calculus, neural\\nnetworks, or other impressive-sounding techniques.\\nThough it is true that you can make millions with nothing more\\nthan Excel, it is also true that there is another tool that, if you are\\nproﬁcient at it, will enable you to backtest trading strategies much\\nmore efﬁciently, and may also allow you to retrieve and process\\ndata much more easily than you otherwise can. This tool is called\\nMATLAB®, and it is a mathematical platform that many institutional\\nquantitative strategists and portfolio managers use. Therefore, I will\\ndemonstrate how to backtest the majority of strategies using MAT-\\nLAB. In fact, I have included a brief tutorial in the appendix on how\\nto do some basic programming in MATLAB. For many retail traders,\\nMATLAB is too expensive to purchase, but there are cheaper alter-\\nnatives, which I will mention in Chapter 3 on backtesting. Further-\\nmore, many university students can either purchase a cheaper stu-\\ndent MATLAB license or they already have free access to it through\\ntheir schools.\\nWHAT WILL YOU FIND IN THIS BOOK?\\nThis book is deﬁnitely not designed as an encyclopedia of quantita-\\ntive trading techniques or terminologies. It will not even be about\\nspeciﬁc proﬁtable strategies (although you can reﬁne the few ex-\\nample strategies embedded here to make them quite proﬁtable.) In-\\nstead, this is a book that teaches you how to ﬁnd a proﬁtable strategy\\nyourself. It teaches you the characteristics of a good strategy, how\\nto reﬁne and backtest a strategy to ensure that it has good historical\\nperformance, and, more importantly, to ensure that it will remain'),\n",

But even for readers who\\nlearned about this kind of trading from the mainstream media\\nbefore, it is worth clearing up some common misconceptions.\\nQuantitative trading, also known as algorithmic trading, is the\\ntrading of securities based strictly on the buy/sell decisions of com-\\nputer algorithms. The computer algorithms are designed and per-\\nhaps programmed by the traders themselves, based on the histor-\\nical performance of the encoded strategy tested against historical\\nﬁnancial data.\\nIs quantitative trading just a fancy name for technical analysis,\\nthen? Granted, a strategy based on technical analysis can be part of\\na quantitative trading system if it can be fully encoded as computer\\nprograms. However, not all technical analysis can be regarded as\\nquantitative trading. For example, certain chartist techniques such\\nas “look for the formation of a head and shoulders pattern” might\\nnot be included in a quantitative trader’s arsenal because they are\\nquite subjective and may not be quantiﬁable.\\nYet quantitative trading includes more than just technical anal-\\nysis. Many quantitative trading systems incorporate fundamental\\ndata in their inputs: numbers such as revenue, cash ﬂow, debt-to-\\nequity ratio, and others.

When it comes to judging the current ﬁnancial per-\\nformance of a company compared to its peers or compared to its\\nhistorical performance, the computer is often just as good as hu-\\nman ﬁnancial analysts—and the computer can watch thousands of\\nsuch companies all at once. Some advanced quantitative systems\\ncan even incorporate news events as inputs: Nowadays, it is pos-\\nsible to use a computer to parse and understand the news report.\\n(After all, I used to be a researcher in this very ﬁeld at IBM, work-\\ning on computer systems that can understand approximately what a\\ndocument is about.)\\nSo you get the picture: As long as you can convert information\\ninto bits and bytes that the computer can understand, it can be re-\\ngarded as part of quantitative trading.\\nWHO CAN BECOME A\\nQUANTITATIVE TRADER?\\nIt is true that most institutional quantitative traders received their\\nadvanced degrees as physicists, mathematicians, engineers, or com-\\nputer scientists. This kind of training in the hard sciences is often\\nnecessary when you want to analyze or trade complex derivative\\ninstruments. But those instruments are not the focus in this book.\\nThere is no law stating that one can become wealthy only by work-\\ning with complicated ﬁnancial instruments. (In fact, one can become\\nquite poor trading complex mortgage-backed securities, as the ﬁnan-\\ncial crisis of 2007–08 and the demise of Bear Stearns have shown.)\\nThe kind of quantitative trading I focus on is calledstatistical ar-\\nbitrage trading.Statistical arbitrage deals with the simplest ﬁnan-\\ncial instruments: stocks, futures, and sometimes currencies. One\\ndoes not need an advanced degree to become a statistical arbitrage\\ntrader. If you have taken a few high school–level courses in math,\\nstatistics, computer programming, or economics, you are probably\\nas qualiﬁed as anyone to tackle some of the basic statistical arbi-\\ntrage strategies.'),\n",

Not necessarily.\\nI received a PhD from one of the top physics departments of the\\nworld (Cornell’s). I worked as a successful researcher in one of the\\ntop computer science research groups in the world (at that temple of\\nhigh-techdom: IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center). Then I worked\\nin a string of top investment banks and hedge funds as a researcher\\nand ﬁnally trader, including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and so\\non. As a researcher and trader in these august institutions, I had al-\\nways strived to use some of the advanced mathematical techniques\\nand training that I possessed and applied them to statistical arbi-\\ntrage trading. Hundreds of millions of dollars of trades later, what\\nwas the result? Losses, more losses, and losses as far as the eye can\\nsee, for my employers and their investors. Finally, I quit the ﬁnan-\\ncial industry in frustration, set up a spare bedroom in my home as\\nmy trading ofﬁce, and started to trade the simplest but still quan-\\ntitative strategies I know. These are strategies that any smart high\\nschool student can easily research and execute. For the ﬁrst time\\nin my life, my trading strategies became proﬁtable (one of which is\\ndescribed in Example 3.6), and has been the case ever since. The\\nlesson I learned? As Einstein said: “Make everything as simple as\\npossible.” But not simpler.\\n(Stay tuned: I will detail more reasons why independent traders\\ncan beat institutional money managers at their own game in\\nChapter 8.)\\nThough I became a quantitative trader through a fairly tradi-\\ntional path, many others didn’t. Who are the typical independent\\nquantitative traders? Among people I know, they include a former\\ntrader at a hedge fund that has gone out of business, a computer pro-\\ngrammer who used to work for a brokerage, a former trader at one\\nof the exchanges, a former investment banker, a former biochemist,\\nand an architect. Some of them have received advanced technical\\ntraining, but others have only basic familiarity of high school–level\\nstatistics.

As far as I know, most of them\\nare doing quite well on their own, while enjoying the enormous free-\\ndom that independence brings.\\nBesides having gained some knowledge of ﬁnance through their\\nformer jobs, the fact that these traders have saved up a nest egg\\nfor their independent venture is obviously important too. When one\\nplunges into independent trading, fear of losses and of being iso-\\nlated from the rest of the world is natural, and so it helps to have\\nboth a prior appreciation of risks and some savings to lean on. It is\\nimportant not to have a need for immediate proﬁts to sustain your\\ndaily living, as strategies have intrinsic rates of returns that cannot\\nbe hurried (see Chapter 6).\\nInstead of fear, some of you are planning to trade because of\\nthe love of thrill and danger, or an incredible self-conﬁdence that\\ninstant wealth is imminent. This is also a dangerous emotion to bring\\nto independent quantitative trading. As I hope to persuade you in\\nthis chapter and in the rest of the book, instant wealth is not the\\nobjective of quantitative trading.\\nThe ideal independent quantitative trader is therefore someone\\nwho has some prior experience with ﬁnance or computer program-\\nming, who has enough savings to withstand the inevitable losses and\\nperiods without income, and whose emotion has found the right bal-\\nance between fear and greed.\\nTHE BUSINESS CASE FOR\\nQUANTITATIVE TRADING\\nA lot of us are in the business of quantitative trading because it is\\nexciting, intellectually stimulating, ﬁnancially rewarding, or perhaps\\nit is the only thing we are good at doing.

Here are some of the most\\nimportant.\\nScalability\\nCompared to most small businesses (other than certain dot-coms),\\nquantitative trading is very scalable (up to a point). It is easy to ﬁnd\\nyourselves trading millions of dollars in the comfort of your own\\nhome, as long as your strategy is consistently proﬁtable. This is be-\\ncause scaling up often just means changing a number in your pro-\\ngram. This number is calledleverage. You do not need to negotiate\\nwith a banker or a venture capitalist to borrow more capital for your\\nbusiness. The brokerages stand ready and willing to do that. If you\\nare a member of a proprietary trading ﬁrm (more on this later in\\nChapter 4 on setting up a business), you may even be able to obtain\\na leverage far exceeding that allowed by Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (SEC) Regulation T. It is not unheard of for a propri-\\netary trading ﬁrm to let you trade a portfolio worth $2 million in-\\ntraday even if you have only $50,000 equity in your account (a×40\\nleverage). At the same time, quantitative trading is deﬁnitely not a\\nget-rich-quick scheme. You should hope to have steadily increasing\\nproﬁts, but most likely it won’t be 200 percent a year, unlike starting\\na dot-com or a software ﬁrm. In fact, as I will explain in Chapter 6\\non money and risk management, it is dangerous to overleverage in\\npursuit of overnight riches.\\nDemand on Time\\nRunning most small businesses takes a lot of your time, at least\\ninitially. Quantitative trading takes relatively little of your time. By\\nits very nature, quantitative trading is a highly automated business.\\nSometimes, the more you manually interfere with the system and\\noverride its decision, the worse it will perform.

Alas, the spirit is willing but the ﬂesh is weak: I often\\ncannot resist the urge to take a look (sometimes many looks) at\\nthe intraday P&L of the various strategies on my trading screens. In\\nextreme situations, I might even be transﬁxed by the huge swings\\nin P&L and be tempted to intervene by manually exiting positions.\\nFortunately, I have learned to better resist the temptation as time\\ngoes on.\\nThe urge to intervene manually is also strong when I have too\\nmuch time on my hands.

If the backtest performance is good, what\\nsteps do you need to take to implement the strategy, in terms of both\\nthe business structure and the technological infrastructure? If the\\nstrategy is proﬁtable in initial real-life trading, how does one scale\\nup the capital to make it into a growing income stream while manag-\\ning the inevitable (but, hopefully, only occasional) losses that come\\nwith trading? These nuts and bolts of quantitative trading will be\\ntackled in Chapters 2 through 6.\\nThough the list of processes to go through in order to get to the\\nﬁnal destination of sustained and growing proﬁtability may seem\\nlong and daunting, in reality it may be faster and easier than many\\nother businesses. When I ﬁrst started as an independent trader, it\\ntook me only three months to ﬁnd and backtest my ﬁrst new strat-\\negy, set up a new brokerage account with $100,000 capital, imple-\\nment the execution system, and start trading the strategy. The strat-\\negy immediately became proﬁtable in the ﬁrst month. Back in the\\ndot-com era, I started an Internet software ﬁrm. It took about 3 times\\nmore investment, 5 times more human-power, and 24 times longer\\nto ﬁnd out that the business model didn’t work, whereupon all in-\\nvestors including myself lost 100 percent of their investments. Com-\\npared to that experience, it really has been a breeze trading quanti-\\ntatively and proﬁtably.'),\n",

I then tried a few simple modiﬁca-\\ntions, such as decreasing the holding period and entering and exiting\\nat different times than suggested, and was able to turn this strategy\\ninto one of my main proﬁt centers.

Trading futures, currencies, and options can offer you\\nhigher leverage than stocks; intraday positions allow a Regulation\\nT leverage of 4, while interday (overnight) positions allow only a\\nleverage of 2, requiring double the amount of capital for a portfo-\\nlio of the same size. Finally, capital (or leverage) availability de-\\ntermines whether you should focus on directional trades (long or\\nshort only) or dollar-neutral trades (hedged or pair trades). A dollar-\\nneutral portfolio (meaning the market value of the long positions\\nequals the market value of the short positions) or market-neutral\\nportfolio (meaning thebeta of the portfolio with respect to a mar-\\nket index is close to zero, wherebeta measures the ratio between\\nthe expected returns of the portfolio and the expected returns of\\nthe market index) require twice the capital or leverage of a long- or\\nshort-only portfolio.

It affects how much you can spend on various infrastruc-\\nture, data, and software. For example, if you have low trading capi-\\ntal, your online brokerage will not be likely to supply you with real-\\ntime market data for too many stocks, so you can’t really have a\\nstrategy that requires real-time market data over a large universe of\\nstocks. (You can, of course, subscribe to a third-party market data\\nvendor, but then the extra cost may not be justiﬁable if your trad-\\ning capital is low.) Similarly, clean historical stock data with high\\nfrequency costs more than historical daily stock data, so a high-\\nfrequency stock-trading strategy may not be feasible with small cap-\\nital expenditure. For historical stock data, there is another quality\\nthat may be even more important than their frequencies: whether\\nthe data are free of survivorship bias. I will deﬁne survivorship bias\\nin the following section. Here, we just need to know that historical\\nstock data without survivorship bias are much more expensive than\\nthose that have such a bias.

Though a strategy may have the same average\\nreturn as the benchmark, perhaps it delivered positive returns every\\nmonth while the benchmark occasionally suffered some very bad\\nmonths. In this case, we would still deem the strategy superior.

The maximum drawdownis the difference\\nbetween the global maximum of the equity curve with the global\\nminimum of the curve after the occurrence of the global maximum\\n(time order matters here: The global minimum must occur later\\nthan the global maximum). The global maximum is called the “high\\nwatermark.” Themaximum drawdown duration is the longest it\\nhas taken for the equity curve to recover losses.\\nMore often, drawdowns are measured in percentage terms, with\\nthe denominator being the equity at the high watermark, and the nu-\\nmerator being the loss of equity since reaching the high watermark.\\nFigure 2.1 illustrates a typical drawdown, the maximum draw-\\ndown, and the maximum drawdown duration of an equity curve.\\nI will include a tutorial in Example 3.5 on how to compute these\\nquantities from a table of daily proﬁts and losses using either Excel\\nor MATLAB.

It is therefore something we would want to mini-\\nmize. You have to ask yourself, realistically, how deep and how long\\na drawdown will you be able to tolerate and not liquidate your port-\\nfolio and shut down your strategy? Would it be 20 percent and three\\nmonths, or 10 percent and one month? Comparing your tolerance\\nwith the numbers obtained from the backtest of a candidate strat-\\negy determines whether that strategy is for you.\\nEven if the author of the strategy you read about did not pub-\\nlish the precise numbers for drawdowns, you should still be able to\\nmake an estimate from a graph of its equity curve. For example, in\\nFigure 2.1, you can see that the longest drawdown goes from around\\nFebruary 2001 to around October 2002. So the maximum drawdown\\nduration is about 20 months. Also, at the beginning of the maximum\\ndrawdown, the equity was about $2.3× 104, and at the end, about\\n$0.5 × 104. So the maximum drawdown is about $1.8× 104.\\nHow Will Transaction Costs Affect the Strategy?\\nEvery time a strategy buys and sells a security, it incurs a trans-\\naction cost. The more frequent it trades, the larger the impact of\\ntransaction costs will be on the proﬁtability of the strategy. These\\ntransaction costs are not just due to commission fees charged by\\nthe broker.

This delay can cause a “slippage,” the difference be-\\ntween the price that triggers the order and the execution price. Of\\ncourse, this slippage can be of either sign, but on average it will be\\na cost rather than a gain to the trader. (If you ﬁnd that it is a gain on\\naverage, you should change your program to deliberately delay the\\ntransmission of the order by a few seconds!)\\nTransaction costs vary widely for different kinds of securities.\\nYou can typically estimate it by taking half the average bid-ask\\nspread of a security and then adding the commission if your or-\\nder size is not much bigger than the average sizes of the best bid\\nand offer. If you are trading S&P 500 stocks, for example, the aver-\\nage transaction cost (excluding commissions, which depend on your\\nbrokerage) would be about 5 basis points (that is, ﬁve-hundredths of\\na percent). Note that I count a round-trip transaction of a buy and\\nthen a sell as two transactions—hence, a round trip will cost 10 ba-\\nsis points in this example. If you are trading ES, the E-mini S&P 500\\nfutures, the transaction cost will be about 1 basis point. Sometimes\\nthe authors whose strategies you read about will disclose that they\\nhave included transaction costs in their backtest performance, but\\nmore often they will not. If they haven’t, then you just to have to\\nassume that the results are before transactions, and apply your own\\njudgment to its validity.\\nAs an example of the impact of transaction costs on a strategy,\\nconsider this simple mean-reverting strategy on ES. It is based on\\nBollinger bands: that is, every time the price exceeds plus or minus\\n2 moving standard deviations of its moving average, short or buy, re-\\nspectively. Exit the position when the price reverts back to within 1\\nmoving standard deviation of the moving average. If you allow your-\\nself to enter and exit every ﬁve minutes, you will ﬁnd that the Sharpe\\nratio is about 3 without transaction costs—very excellent indeed!\\nUnfortunately, the Sharpe ratio is reduced to –3 if we subtract 1 ba-\\nsis point as transaction costs, making it a very unproﬁtable strategy.\\nFor another example of the impact of transaction costs, see\\nExample 3.7.'),\n",

(The same term can be applied to mutual fund or hedge\\nfund databases that do not include funds that went out of business.)\\nBacktesting a strategy using data with survivorship bias can be dan-\\ngerous because it may inﬂate the historical performance of the strat-\\negy. This is especially true if the strategy has a “value” bent; that is,\\nit tends to buy stocks that are cheap. Some stocks were cheap be-\\ncause the companies were going bankrupt shortly. So if your strat-\\negy includes only those cases when the stocks were very cheap\\nbut eventually survived (and maybe prospered) and neglects those\\ncases where the stocks ﬁnally did get delisted, the backtest perfor-\\nmance will, of course, be much better than what a trader would ac-\\ntually have suffered at that time.\\nSo when you read about a “buy on the cheap” strategy that has\\ngreat performance, ask the author of that strategy whether it was\\ntested on survivorship bias–free (sometimes called “point-in-time”)\\ndata. If not, be skeptical of its results. (A toy strategy that illustrates\\nthis can be found in Example 3.3.)\\nHow Did the Performance of the Strategy\\nChange over the Years?\\nMost strategies performed much better 10 years ago than now, at\\nleast in a backtest. There weren’t as many hedge funds running\\nquantitative strategies then. Also, bid-ask spreads were much wider\\nthen: So if you assumed the transaction cost today was applicable\\nthroughout the backtest, the earlier period would have unrealisti-\\ncally high returns.\\nSurvivorship bias in the data might also contribute to the good\\nperformance in the early period. The reason that survivorship bias\\nmainly inﬂates the performance of an earlier period is that the fur-\\nther back we go in our backtest, the more missing stocks we will'),\n",

Therefore, when judging the\\nsuitability of a strategy, one must pay particular attention to its per-\\nformance in the most recent few years, and not be fooled by the\\noverall performance, which inevitably includes some rosy numbers\\nback in the old days.\\nFinally, “regime shifts” in the ﬁnancial markets can mean that\\nﬁnancial data from an earlier period simply cannot be ﬁtted to the\\nsame model that is applicable today. Major regime shifts can oc-\\ncur because of changes in securities market regulation (such as\\ndecimalization of stock prices or the elimination of the short-sale\\nrule, which I allude to in Chapter 5) or other macroeconomic events\\n(such as the subprime mortgage meltdown).\\nThis point may be hard to swallow for many statistically minded\\nreaders.

But, in general, the more rules the strategy\\nhas, and the more parameters the model has, the more likely it is go-\\ning to suffer data-snooping bias. Simple models are often the ones\\nthat will stand the test of time. (See the sidebar on my views on\\nartiﬁcial intelligence and stock picking.)\\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND STOCK\\nPICKING*\\nThere was an article in theNew York Timesa short while ago about a new hedge\\nfund launched by Mr. Ray Kurzweil, a pioneer in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence.\\n(Thanks to my fellow blogger, Yaser Anwar, who pointed it out to me.) According\\nto Kurzweil, the stock-picking decisions in this fund are supposed to be made\\nby machines that “... can observe billions of market transactions to see patterns\\nwe could never see” (quoted in Duhigg, 2006).\\nWhile I am certainly a believer in algorithmic trading, I have become a skep-\\ntic when it comes to trading based on “artiﬁcial intelligence.”\\nAt the risk of oversimpliﬁcation, we can characterize artiﬁcial intelligence\\n(AI) as trying to ﬁt past data points into a function with many, many param-\\neters. This is the case for some of the favorite tools of AI: neural networks,\\ndecision trees, and genetic algorithms. With many parameters, we can for sure\\ncapture small patterns that no human can see. But do these patterns persist?\\nOr are they random noises that will never replay again? Experts in AI assure\\nus that they have many safeguards against ﬁtting the function to transient\\nnoise. And indeed, such tools have been very eﬀective in consumer market-\\ning and credit card fraud detection. Apparently, the patterns of consumers and\\nthefts are quite consistent over time, allowing such AI algorithms to work even\\nwith a large number of parameters. However, from my experience, these safe-\\nguards work far less well in ﬁnancial markets prediction, and overﬁtting to\\nthe noise in historical data remains a rampant problem. As a matter of fact,\\nI have built ﬁnancial predictive models based on many of these AI algorithms in\\nthe past. Every time a carefully constructed model that seems to work marvels\\nin backtest came up, they inevitably performed miserably going forward. The\\nmain reason for this seems to be that the amount of statistically independent\\nﬁnancial data is far more limited compared to the billions of independent con-\\nsumer and credit transactions available. (You may think that there is a lot of tick-\\nby-tick ﬁnancial data to mine, but such data is serially correlated and far from\\nindependent.)'),\n",

In\\nkeeping with the focus on start-ups in this book, I start with those\\nwith which I am familiar and that can be purchased economically\\nand are widely used.\\nExcel\\nThis is the most basic and most common tool for traders, whether\\nretail or institutional. You can enhance its power further if you can\\nwrite Visual Basic macros. The beauty of Excel is “What you see\\nis what you get” (or WYSIWYG in computing parlance). Data and\\nprogram are all in one place so that nothing is hidden. Also, a com-\\nmon backtesting pitfall called “look-ahead bias,” which will be ex-\\nplained later, is unlikely to occur in Excel (unless you use macros,\\nwhich renders it no longer WYSIWYG) because you can easily align\\nthe dates with the various data columns and signals on a spread-\\nsheet. Another advantage of Excel is that often backtesting and live\\ntrade generation can be done from the same spreadsheet, eliminat-\\ning any duplication of programming efforts. The major disadvantage\\nof Excel is that it can be used to backtest only fairly simple models.\\nBut, as I explained in the previous chapter, simple models are often\\nthe best!\\nMATLAB\\nMATLAB R⃝ (www.mathworks.com) is one of the most common\\nbacktesting platforms used by quantitative analysts and traders in\\nlarge institutions.

However, there are several clones of\\nMATLAB on the market where you can write and use codes that\\nare very similar to MATLAB:\\nr O-Matrix (www.omatrix.com)\\nr Octave (www.gnu.org/software/octave)\\nr Scilab (www.scilab.org)\\nThese clones may cost only several hundred dollars, or may be\\nentirely free.

The other\\ndrawback of MATLAB is that it is very useful for backtesting but\\nclumsy to use as an execution platform.

One way to overcome this\\nproblem is to start collecting point-in-time data yourself for the ben-\\neﬁt of your future backtest.

Let’s look at what we would have picked if we\\nhad a good, survivorship-bias-free database:\\nClosing Price Closing Price\\nSYMBOL on 1/2/2001 on 1/2/2002 Terminal Price\\nETYS 0.2188 NaN 0.125\\nMDM 0.3125 0.49 0.49\\nINTW 0.4063 NaN 0.11\\nFDHG 0.5 NaN 0.33\\nOGNC 0.6875 NaN 0.2\\nMPLX 0.7188 NaN 0.8\\nGTS 0.75 NaN 0.35\\nBUYX 0.75 NaN 0.17\\nPSIX 0.75 NaN 0.2188\\nAll but MDM were delisted sometime between 1/2/2001 and 1/2/2002\\n(after all, the dot-com bubble was seriously bursting then!). The NaNs indi-\\ncate those with nonexistent closing prices on 1/2/2002. The Terminal Price\\ncolumn indicates the last prices at which the stocks were traded on or before\\n1/2/2002. The total return on this portfolio in that year was –42 percent.\\nNow, let’s look at what we would have picked if our database had sur-\\nvivorship bias and actually missed all those stocks that were delisted that\\nyear. We would then have picked the following list instead:\\nSYMBOL Closing Price on 1/2/2001 Closing Price on 1/2/2002\\nMDM 0.3125 0.49\\nENGA 0.8438 0.44\\nNEOF 0.875 27.9\\nENP 0.875 0.05\\nMVL 0.9583 2.5\\nURBN 1.0156 3.0688\\nFNV 1.0625 0.81\\nAPT 1.125 0.88\\nFLIR 1.2813 9.475\\nRAZF 1.3438 0.25\\n41'),\n",

What this means is that even when\\nyou had placed a buy limit order below the recorded high of a day, it\\nmight not have been ﬁlled, and vice versa for a sell limit order. (This\\ncould be due to the fact that a very small order was transacted at the\\nhigh, or the execution could have occurred on a market to which\\nyour order was not routed.

Hence,\\na backtest that relies on high and low data is less reliable than one\\nthat relies on the open and close.\\nActually, sometimes even a market on open (MOO) or market\\non close (MOC) order might not be ﬁlled at the historical open\\nand close prices shown in your data. This is due to the fact that\\nthe historical prices shown may be due to the primary exchange\\n(e.g., New York Stock Exchange [NYSE]), or it may be a composite\\nprice including all the regional exchanges. Depending on where your\\norder was routed, it may be ﬁlled at a different price from the his-\\ntorical opening or closing price shown in your dataset. Neverthe-\\nless, the discrepancies of the open and close prices usually have\\nless impact on backtest performance than the errors in the high\\nand low prices, since the latter almost always inﬂate your backtest\\nreturns.\\nAfter retrieving the data from a database, it is often advisable to\\ndo a quick error check. The simplest way to do this is to calculate\\nthe daily returns based on the data. If you have open, high, low, and\\nclose prices, you can calculate the various combinations of daily\\nreturns such as from the previous high to today’s close as well. You'),\n",

Notice that I did not include average an-\\nnualized returns, the measure most commonly quoted by investors,\\nbecause if you use this measure, you have to tell people a number\\nof things about what denominator you use to calculate returns. For\\nexample, in a long-short strategy, did you use just one side of capital\\nor both sides in the denominator? Is the return a leveraged one (the\\ndenominator is based on account equity), or is it unleveraged (the\\ndenominator is based on market value of the portfolio)? If the equity\\nor market value changes daily, do you use a moving average as the\\ndenominator, or just the value at the end of each day or each month?\\nMost (but not all) of these problems associated with comparing re-\\nturns can be avoided by quoting Sharpe ratio and drawdown instead\\nas the standard performance measures.\\nI introduced the concepts of the Sharpe ratio, maximum draw-\\ndown, and maximum drawdown duration in Chapter 2. Here, I will\\njust note a number of subtleties associated with calculating the\\nSharpe ratio, and give some computational examples in both Excel\\nand MATLAB.\\nThere is one subtlety that often confounds even seasoned port-\\nfolio managers when they calculate Sharpe ratios: should we or\\nshouldn’t we subtract the risk-free rate from the returns of a dollar-\\nneutral portfolio?

Meanwhile, the mar-\\ngin balance you have to maintain earns a credit interest close to the\\nrisk-free raterF. So let’s say the strategy return (the portfolio return\\nminus the contribution from the credit interest) isR, and the risk-\\nfree rate isrF. Then the excess return used in calculating the Sharpe\\nratio isR + rF – rF = R. So, essentially, you can ignore the risk-free\\nrate in the whole calculation and just focus on the returns due to\\nyour stock positions.\\nSimilarly, if you have a long-only day-trading strategy that does\\nnot hold positions overnight, you again have no need to subtract the\\nrisk-free rate from the strategy return in order to obtain the excess\\nreturns, since you do not have ﬁnancing costs in this case, either. In\\ngeneral, you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy\\nreturns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs\\nﬁnancing cost.\\nTo further facilitate comparison across strategies, most traders\\nannualize the Sharpe ratio. Most people know how to annualize the\\naverage returns. For example, if you have been using monthly re-\\nturns, then the average annual return is just 12 times the average\\nmonthly return.\\nHowever, annualizing the standard deviation of returns is a bit\\ntrickier. Here, based on the assumption that the monthly returns are\\nserially uncorrelated (Sharpe, 1994), the annual standard deviation\\nof returns is\\n√\\n12 times the monthly standard deviation. Hence, over-\\nall, the annualized Sharpe ratio would be\\n√\\n12 times the monthly\\nSharpe ratio.\\nIn general, if you calculate your average and standard deviation\\nof returns based on a certain trading periodT, whether T is a month,\\na day, or an hour, and you want to annualize these quantities, you\\nhave to ﬁrst ﬁnd out how many such trading periods there are in a\\nyear (call itNT). Then\\nAnnualized Sharpe Ratio=\\n√\\nNT × Sharpe Ratio Based onT'),\n",

I will describe two of the most common ones here,\\nwith tips on how to avoid them.\\nLook-Ahead Bias\\nThis error refers to the situation when you are using information\\nthat was available only at a timeahead of the instant the trade was\\nmade. For example, if your trade entry rule reads: “Buy when the\\nstock is within 1 percent of the day’s low,” you have introduced a\\nlook-ahead bias in your strategy, because you could not possibly\\nhave known what the day’s low was until the market closed that\\nday. Another example: Suppose a model involves a linear regression\\nﬁt of two price series. If you use the regression coefﬁcients obtained\\nfrom the entire data set to determine your daily trading signals, you\\nhave again introduced look-ahead bias.\\nHow do we avoid look-ahead bias? Uselagged historical data\\nfor calculating signals at every opportunity. Lagging a series of data\\nmeans that you calculate all the quantities like moving averages,\\nhighs and lows, or even volume, based on data up to the close of the\\nprevious trading period only. (Of course, you needn’t lag the data if\\nyour strategy enters only at the close of the period.)\\nLook-ahead bias is easier to avoid using Excel or other WYSI-\\nWYG programs than using MATLAB. This is because it is easy to\\nalign all the different columns of data in Excel and ensure that the\\nformula in each cell is computed based on the rows above the cur-\\nrent row. It would be visually obvious when one is using current\\nday’s data in generating signals, given the cell-highlighting function-\\nality in Excel. (Double-clicking a cell with a formula will highlight\\nthe cells of data this formula utilizes.) With MATLAB, you have to\\nbe more careful and remember to run a lag function on certain se-\\nries used for signal generation.\\nEven with all the care and caution that goes into creating a\\nbacktest program without look-ahead bias, sometimes we may\\nstill let some of it slip in. Some look-ahead bias is quite subtle in\\nnature and not easy to avoid, especially if you are using MATLAB.'),\n",

Now truncate your historical data so\\nthat the most recent portion (sayN days) is removed. So if the last\\nday in the original data isT, then the last day in the truncated data\\nshould beT-N. N could be 10 days to 100 days. Now run the back-\\ntest program again using the truncated data and save the resulting\\npositions into a new ﬁle B. Truncate the most recentN rows of the\\npositions ﬁle A so that both A and B have the same number of rows\\n(days) in them, and the last day in both ﬁle A and B should beT-N.\\nFinally, check if A and B are identical in their positions. If not, you\\nhave a look-ahead bias in your backtest program that you must ﬁnd\\nand correct, because the discrepancies in positions mean that you\\nare inadvertently using the truncated part of the historical data (the\\npart that lies ahead of dayT-N) in determining the positions in ﬁle\\nA. I will illustrate this somewhat convoluted procedure at the end of\\nExample 3.6.\\nData-Snooping Bias\\nIn Chapter 2, I mentioned data-snooping bias—the danger that back-\\ntest performance is inﬂated relative to the future performance of\\nthe strategy because we have overoptimized the parameters of the\\nmodel based on transient noise in the historical data. Data snoop-\\ning bias is pervasive in the business of predictive statistical models\\nof historical data, but is especially serious in ﬁnance because of the\\nlimited amount of independent data we have. High-frequency data,\\nwhile in abundant supply, is useful only for high-frequency models.\\nAnd while we have stock market data stretching back to the early\\nparts of the twentieth century, only data within the past 10 years\\nare really suitable for building predictive model. Furthermore, as\\ndiscussed in Chapter 2, regime shifts may render even data that are\\njust a few years old obsolete for backtesting purposes. The less inde-\\npendent data you have, the fewer adjustable parameters you should\\nemploy in your trading model.'),\n",

Numerous choices one makes in creating a trad-\\ning model can be affected by repeated backtesting on the same\\ndata set—decisions such as whether to enter at the open or close,\\nwhether to hold the positions overnight, whether to trade large-cap\\nor mid-cap stocks. Often, these qualitative decisions are made to\\noptimize the backtest performance, but they may not be optimal go-\\ning forward. It is almost impossible to completely eliminate data-\\nsnooping bias as long as we are building data-driven models. How-\\never, there are ways to mitigate the bias.\\nSample Size The most basic safeguard against data-snooping bias\\nis to ensure that you have a sufﬁcient amount of backtest data rel-\\native to the number of free parameters you want to optimize. As a\\nrule of thumb, let’s assume that the number of data points needed\\nfor optimizing your parameters is equal to 252 times the number\\nof free parameters your model has. (This assumption of propor-\\ntionality is not based on any survey of the vast statistical litera-\\nture, but purely on experience.) So, for example, let’s assume you\\nhave a daily trading model with three parameters. Then you should\\nhave at least three years’ worth of backtest data with daily prices.\\nHowever, if you have a three-parameter trading model that updates\\npositions every minute, then you should have at least 252/390 year,\\nor about seven months, of one-minute backtest data. (Note that if\\nyou have a daily trading model, then even if you have seven months\\nof minute-by-minute data points, effectively you only have about\\n7 × 21 = 147 data points, far from sufﬁcient for testing a three-\\nparameter model.)\\nOut-of-Sample Testing Divide your historical data into two parts.\\nSave the second (more recent) part of the data for out-of-sample\\ntesting. When you build the model, optimize the parameters as well\\nas other qualitative decisions on the ﬁrst portion (called thetrain-\\ning set), but test the resulting model on the second portion (called'),\n",

(The two portions should be roughly equal in size, but if\\nthere is insufﬁcient training data, we should at least have one-third\\nas much test data as training data. The minimum size of the training\\nset is determined by the rule of thumb in the previous section.) Ide-\\nally, the set of optimal parameters and decisions for the ﬁrst part of\\nthe backtest period is also the optimal set for the second period, but\\nthings are rarely this perfect. The performance on the second part\\nof the data should at least be reasonable. Otherwise, the model has\\ndata-snooping bias built into it, and one way to cure it is to simplify\\nthe model and eliminate some parameters.\\nA more rigorous (albeit more computationally intensive)\\nmethod of out-of-sample testing is to use moving optimization of\\nthe parameters. In this case, the parameters themselves are con-\\nstantly adapting to the changing historical data, and data-snooping\\nbias with respect to parameters is eliminated. (See the sidebar on\\nparameterless trading models.)\\nPARAMETERLESS TRADING MODELS*\\nA portfolio manager whom I used to work for liked to proudly proclaim that\\nhis trading models have “no free parameters.” In keeping with the tradition of\\nsecrecy in our industry, he would not divulge his technique further.\\nLately, I have begun to understand what a trading model with no free pa-\\nrameters means. It doesn’t mean that it does not contain, for example, any\\nlookback period for calculating trends, or thresholds for entry or exit. I think\\nthat would be impossible. It just means that all such parameters aredynami-\\ncally optimized in a moving lookback window. This way, if you ask, “Does the\\nmodel have a ﬁxed proﬁt cap?,” the trader can honestly reply: “No, proﬁt cap is\\nnot an input parameter. It is determined by the model itself.”\\nThe advantage of a parameterless trading model is that it minimizes the\\ndanger of overﬁtting the model to multiple input parameters (the so-called\\n“data-snooping bias”). So the backtest performance should be much closer to\\nthe actual forward performance.\\n(Note that parameter optimization does not necessarily mean picking one\\nbest set of parameters that give the best backtest performance. Often, it is\\nbetter to make a trading decision based on some kind ofaverages over diﬀerent\\nsets of parameters.)\\nNow, it is quite computationally challenging to optimize all these parame-\\nters just in time for your next order, but it is often even more diﬃcult to do that\\nin a backtest, given that a multidimensional optimization needs to be performed'),\n",

As a result, I personally have seldom traded parameter-\\nless models, until I get to research my regime-switching model described in\\nExample 7.1. That model is almost parameterless (I left out a few parameters\\nfrom optimization because of a lack of time, not because of any technical dif-\\nﬁculties). How was I able to perform backtest parameter optimization within a\\nfew minutes in this case? I got to use a high-end backtesting platform (Alphacet\\nDiscovery).\\n*This section was adapted from my blog article “Parameterless Trading Models,” which you\\ncan ﬁnd at epchan.blogspot.com/2008/05/parameterless-trading-models.html.\\nThe ultimate out-of-sample testing is familiar to many traders,\\nand it is calledpaper trading.Running the model on actual unseen\\ndata is the most reliable way to test it (short of actually trading it).\\nPaper trading not only allows you to perform a truly honest out-\\nof-sample test; it often allows you to discover look-ahead errors in\\nyour programs, as well as making you aware of various operational\\nissues. I will discuss paper trading in Chapter 5.\\nIf the strategy that you are testing comes from a published\\nsource, and you are just conducting a backtest to verify that the re-\\nsults are correct, then the entire period between the time of publi-\\ncation and the time that you tested the strategy is a genuine out-of-\\nsample period. As long as you do not optimize the parameters of the\\npublished model on the out-of-sample period, this period is as good\\nas paper trading the strategy.\\nExample 3.6: Pair Trading of GLD and GDX\\nThis example will illustrate how to separate the data into a training set and a\\ntest set. We will backtest a pair-trading strategy and optimize its parameters\\non the training set and look at the eﬀect on the test set.\\nGLD versus GDX is a good candidate for pair trading because GLD\\nreﬂects the spot price of gold, and GDX is a basket of gold-mining\\nstocks. It makes intuitive sense that their prices should move in tandem.\\nI have discussed this pair of ETFs extensively on my blog in connec-\\ntion with cointegration analysis (see, e.g., epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/'),\n",

Do you\\nreally need, say, ﬁve different conditions to determine whether\\nto make that trade? What if you eliminate the conditions one\\nby one—at what point does the performance on the training set\\ndeteriorate to an unacceptable level? And more important: Is there\\na corresponding decrease in performance on the test set as you\\neliminate the conditions? In general, you should eliminate as many\\nconditions, constraints, and parameters as possible as long as\\nthere is no signiﬁcant decrease in performance in the test set, even\\nthough it may decrease performance on the training set. (But you\\nshould not add conditions and parameters, or adjust the parameter\\nvalues, so as to improve performance on the test set: If you do, you\\nhave effectively used the test set as your training set and possibly\\nreintroduce data-snooping bias to your model.)\\nWhen one has reduced the set of parameters and conditions that\\ntrigger a trade to the minimum, and after one has ascertained that\\nsmall variations in these parameters and conditions do not drasti-\\ncally alter the out-of-sample performance, one should consider di-\\nviding the trading capital across the different parameter values and\\nsets of conditions.

It should not\\nsurprise you to ﬁnd that a strategy with a high Sharpe ratio before\\nadding transaction costs can become very unproﬁtable after adding\\nsuch costs. I will illustrate this in Example 3.7.\\nExample 3.7: A Simple Mean-Reverting Model with and\\nwithout Transaction Costs\\nHere is a simple mean-reverting model that is due to Amir Khan-\\ndani and Andrew Lo at MIT (available at web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/\\naugust07.pdf). This strategy is very simple: Buy the stocks with the worst\\nprevious one-day returns, and short the ones with the best previous one-\\nday returns. Despite its utter simplicity, this strategy has had great perfor-\\nmance since 1995, ignoring transaction costs (it has a Sharpe ratio of 4.47\\nin 2006). Our objective here is to ﬁnd out what would happen to its perfor-\\nmance in 2006 if we assume a standard 5-basis-point-per-trade transaction\\ncost. (A trade is deﬁned as a buy or a short, not a round-trip transaction.)\\nThis example strategy not only allows us to illustrate the impact of trans-\\naction costs, it also illustrates the power of MATLAB in backtesting a model\\nthat trades multiple securities—in other words, a typical statistical arbitrage\\nmodel. Backtesting a model with a large number of symbols over multiple\\nyears is often too cumbersome to perform in Excel. But even assuming that\\nyou have MATLAB at your disposal, there is still the question of how to re-\\ntrieve historical data for hundreds of symbols, especially survivorship-bias-\\nfree data. Here, we will put aside the question of survivorship bias because\\nof the expensive nature of such data and just bear in mind that whatever\\nperformance estimates we obtained are upper bounds on the actual perfor-\\nmance of the strategy.\\nWhenever one wants to backtest a stock selection strategy, the ﬁrst\\nquestion is always: Which universe of stocks? The typical starting point is\\nthe S&P 500 stock universe, which is the most liquid set of stocks avail-\\nable. The current list of stocks in the S&P 500 is available for download at\\nthe Standard & Poor’s website (www.standardandpoors.com). Since the con-\\nstituents of this universe change constantly, the list that you download will\\nbe diﬀerent from mine. For ease of comparison, you can ﬁnd my list saved\\nas epchan.com/book/SP500 20071121.xls. The easiest way to download\\nhistorical data for all these stocks is to buy a copy of the HQuote Pro soft-\\nware (referenced earlier in this chapter, available from HQuote.com.) This'),\n",

How to reﬁne a\\nstrategy without introducing data-snooping bias and to remain sim-\\nple with few parameters is more of an art than a science. The guid-\\ning principle is the same as that of parameter optimization: What-\\never changes you make to the strategy to improve its performance\\non the training set, it must also improve the performance on the\\ntest set.\\nOften, there are some very simple strategies that are fairly well\\nknown in traders’ circles and are still somewhat proﬁtable, though\\ntheir returns seem to be diminishing. An example is the pair trad-\\ning of stocks. The reason they are diminishing in returns is that too\\nmany traders are taking advantage of this arbitrage opportunity and\\ngradually erasing the proﬁt margin. However, it is often possible to\\nintroduce minor variations in the basic strategy, which will boost its\\nreturns.\\nThese minor variations are often far less well known than the\\nbasic strategy, and therefore far less well exploited by traders.\\nSometimes they involve excluding certain stocks or groups of stocks\\nfrom the universe. For example, traders often prefer to exclude'),\n",

Dark-pool liquid-\\nity is formed by institutional orders facilitated away from the ex-\\nchanges, or they come from the crossing of internal brokerage cus-\\ntomer orders. These orders are not displayed as bid and ask quotes.\\nSome of the “alternative trading systems” that provide dark-pool\\nliquidity are Liquidnet and ITG’s Posit. Your brokerage may use one\\nor more of these providers, it may only use its internal crossing net-\\nwork, or it may use no alternative trading systems at all.\\nSometimes, a better execution price at a large brokerage due\\nto its state-of-the-art execution system and high-speed access to\\ndeeper dark pools of liquidity will more than compensate for its\\nhigher commissions. This kind of cost/beneﬁt analysis cannot eas-\\nily be carried out unless you actually trade on multiple brokerages\\nsimultaneously and compare the actual execution costs.\\nFor example, I trade through Goldman Sachs’s REDIPlus trading\\nplatform, whose Sigma X execution engine routes orders to both its\\ninternal crossing network as well as to external liquidity providers.\\nI have found that it often improves my execution price by more than\\na few cents per share over execution on Interactive Brokers: more\\nthan enough to offset its higher commissions.\\nAnother consideration is the range of products you can trade.\\nMany retail brokerages or proprietary trading ﬁrms do not allow you\\nto trade futures or foreign currencies. This would be a serious limi-\\ntation to your trading business’s growth.\\nFollowing these two fairly generic criteria, for a quantitative\\ntrader, the next important one is: Does the trading platform offer an\\napplication programming interface (API) so that your trading soft-\\nware can receive live data feed, generate orders, and automatically\\ntransmit the orders for execution in your account? I will discuss\\nmore about API in Chapter 5. The only point to note here is that\\nwithout an API, high-frequency quantitative trading is impossible.\\nClosely related to the availability of API is the availability of pa-\\nper trading accounts. If a brokerage does not offer you a paper trad-\\ning account, it is very hard to test an API without risking real losses.\\nAmong the brokerages I know that offer paper trading accounts are\\nInteractive Brokers, Genesis Securities, PFG Futures (for futures\\ntrading), and Oanda (for currency trading).'),\n",

This does not\\nmatter to the choice of a retail brokerage because, as noted in Ta-\\nble 4.1, retail accounts are insured by the SIPC whereas proprietary\\naccounts are not. Hence, it is important that a proprietary trading\\nﬁrm has a strong balance sheet and good risk management practices\\nto prevent the ﬁrm from collapsing because of bad trades made by\\nits fellow member traders. (WorldCom’s and Refco’s collapses are\\ngood examples.) You should also make sure the ﬁrm is a broker-\\ndealer registered with an exchange, so that it is regularly audited by\\nthe exchange and the SEC.

And, in\\nfact, sometimes each account has its own pros and cons, and you\\nmay want to have the ﬂexibility of keeping all of them open for trad-\\ning different strategies!\\nPHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\\nNow that you have set up the legal and administrative structure of\\nyour trading business, it is time to consider the physical infrastruc-\\nture. This applies to both retail and proprietary traders: Many pro-\\nprietary trading ﬁrms allow their members to trade remotely in their\\nhomes. If you are a proprietary trader who requires minimal coach-\\ning from your account manager and are conﬁdent in your ability to\\nset up the physical trading infrastructure yourself, there is no reason\\nnot to trade remotely.\\nIn the start-up phase of your business, the physical infrastruc-\\nture can be light and simple. You probably have all the compo-\\nnents you need in your home ofﬁce already: a good personal com-\\nputer (practically any new computer with dual-core processors will\\ndo), a high-speed (DSL or cable) Internet connection, and, less well\\nknown, an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) so that your com-\\nputer doesn’t get accidentally shut down in the middle of a trade be-\\ncause of electricity ﬂuctuations. The total initial investment should\\nnot exceed a couple of thousand dollars at the maximum, and the\\nmonthly cost should not be more than $50 or so if you don’t already\\nsubscribe to cable TV.\\nSome traders wonder if having a TV tuned to CNBC or CNN\\nis a good idea. While it certainly won’t hurt, many professional\\nquantitative traders have found that it is not necessary, as long as\\nthey also subscribe to another professional real-time newsfeed, such\\nas Thomson Reuters, Dow Jones, or Bloomberg. While Bloomberg\\ncan cost almost $2,000 a month, various plans offered by Thomson\\nReuters and Dow Jones can cost as little as $100 to $200 (though\\nsome will require an annual contract). Bloomberg also has a free\\nInternet radio stream at www.bloomberg.com/tvradio/radio that an-\\nnounces breaking business news and commentaries. Also, instead'),\n",

(SeeEconomist, 2007a, or Oldﬁeld, 2007.)\\nAs your trading business grows, you may upgrade your infra-\\nstructure gradually. Perhaps you will purchase faster computers. A\\nquad-core computer at the time of this writing is considered fairly\\nhigh end. Of course, when you are reading this, an octal-core or bet-\\nter personal computer will probably be widely available. According\\nto a New York Timesarticle (Markoff, 2007), PCs with octal-core\\nchips will be available as soon as 2010.\\nYou will certainly want to purchase multiple monitors to hook\\nup to the same computer so that you have extended screen space\\nto monitor all the different trading applications and portfolios.\\nMaybe you will want to upgrade your Internet connection to a T1\\nline, too. As discussed in Chapter 2, any delay in the transmis-\\nsion of your order to your brokerage results in slippage, which\\nis quite real in terms of lost proﬁts. In fast-moving markets, ev-\\nery millisecond counts, and an upgrade in your Internet connection\\nspeed may well pay for itself very quickly. (A T1 line can cost any-\\nwhere from $700 to $1,500, whereas a cable/DSL connection is usu-\\nally under $50.

You can in-\\nstall your trading programs on a remote server located in a hosting\\ncompany; in fact, you can even “collocate” your computers contain-\\ning your trading programs at the hosting company.

For certain high-frequency systems, a fully\\nautomated system is indispensable, because any human interven-\\ntion will cause enough delay to seriously derail the performance.\\nHowever, a fully automated system is also complicated and costly\\nto build, often requiring professional programmers with knowledge\\nof high-performance programming languages such as Java, C#, or\\nC++in order to connect to your brokerage’s application program-\\nming interface (API).\\nFor lower-frequency quantitative trading strategies, there is a\\nsemiautomated alternative: One can generate the orders using pro-\\ngrams such as Excel or MATLAB, then submit those orders using\\nbuilt-in tools such as a basket trader or spread trader offered by your\\nbrokerage. If your brokerage provides a dynamic data exchange\\n(DDE) link to Excel (see below), you can also write a macro at-\\ntached to your Excel spreadsheet that allows you to submit orders\\nto the brokerage simply by running the macro. This way, there is\\nno need to build an application in a complicated programming lan-\\nguage. However, it does mean that you would have to perform quite\\na few manual steps in order to submit your orders.\\nWhether you have built a semiautomated or a fully automated\\ntrading system, there is often a need for input data beyond the prices\\nthat your brokerage or data vendor can readily provide you. For ex-\\nample, earnings estimates or dividends data are often not provided\\nas part of the real-time data stream. These nonprice data are typ-\\nically available free of charge from many web sites, but are usu-\\nally embedded in an HTML format and not readily usable. Hence,\\nan automated system also must be able to retrieve such web pages,\\nparse them, and reformat them into a tabular format that your trad-\\ning strategy can utilize. Such web page retrieval and parsing pro-\\ngrams can readily be implemented in MATLAB (see Example 3.1 in\\nChapter 3), or in other scripting languages such as Perl.\\nI will discuss some details of the two kinds of system in the\\nfollowing sections. I will also discuss how to hire a programming'),\n",

Again, before the\\nmarket opens I use MATLAB to retrieve market data, run the pair-\\ntrading algorithm, and write out limit prices for all the pairs in my\\nuniverse. (Note that the limit prices are limits on the spread, not on\\nthe individual stocks. If they were on the individual stocks, ordinary\\nlimit orders would have done the trick and the spread trader would\\nhave been redundant.)

Unfor-\\ntunately, no brokerage that I know of provides an API for MATLAB.\\nHence, MATLAB cannot be used to build the order transmission por-\\ntion of an automated trading system.\\nTheoretically, a fully automated system can be constructed out\\nof an Excel spreadsheet and an attached macro: All you have to\\ndo is to create a loop in your macro so that it updates the cells\\nusing the DDE links and submit orders when appropriate contin-\\nuously throughout the day. Unfortunately, data updates through\\nDDE links are slow, and generally your brokerage limits the num-\\nber of symbols that you can update all at once.

If you have an account at one of the brokerages that supply you with\\nan API, the brokerage can often refer you to some programmers who have ex-\\nperience with their API. (Interactive Brokers, for example, has a special web\\npage that allows programming consultants to oﬀer their services.)

Of course, you can have\\nthem sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs, downloadable for free at many\\nlegal document web sites), but it is almost impossible to ﬁnd out if the pro-\\ngrammers are in fact running your strategies in their personal accounts once\\nthe programs are implemented.

So in this case, the ﬁrst programmer does not know your strategy,\\nand the second programmer does not have the infrastructure to execute the\\nstrategy. Furthermore, neither programmer knows the actual parameter values\\nto use for your strategy.\\nMINIMIZING TRANSACTION COSTS\\nWe saw in Chapter 3 how transaction costs can impact a strategy’s\\nactual return. Besides changing your brokerage or proprietary trad-\\ning ﬁrm to one that charges a lower commission, there are a few\\nthings you can do in your execution method to minimize the trans-\\naction costs.\\nTo cut down on commissions, you can refrain from trading low-\\nprice stocks. Typically, institutional traders do not trade any stocks\\nwith prices lower than $5. Not only do low-price stocks increase\\nyour total commissions costs (since you need to buy or sell more\\nshares for a ﬁxed amount of capital), percentage-wise they also have\\na wider bid-ask spread and therefore increase your total liquidity\\ncosts.\\nIn order to minimize market impact cost, you should limit the\\nsize (number of shares) of your orders based on the liquidity of the\\nstock. One common measure of liquidity is the average daily volume\\n(it is your choice what lookback period you want to average over).\\nAs a rule of thumb, each order should not exceed 1 percent of the\\naverage daily volume. As an independent trader, you may think that\\nit is not easy to reach this 1 percent threshold, and you would be\\nright when the stock in question is a large-cap stock belonging to\\nthe S&P 500. However, you may be surprised by the low liquidity of\\nsome small-cap stocks out there.\\nFor example, at the time of this writing, IRN is a stock in the S&P\\n600 SmallCap Index. It has a three-month average volume of about\\n51,000, and it closed today at $4.45. So 1 percent of this average\\nvolume is just 510 shares, which are worth only $2,269!\\nAnother way to reduce market impact is to scale the size of your\\norders based on the market capitalization of a stock.

A linear scale (i.e., scaling the capital\\nof a stock to be linearly proportional to its market capitalization)\\nwould result in practically zero weights for most small- and micro-\\ncap stocks in your portfolio, and this will take away any beneﬁts of\\ndiversiﬁcation. If we were to use linear scale, the capital weight of\\nthe largest large-cap stock will be about 10,000 of the smallest small-\\ncap stock. To reap the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation, we should not al-\\nlow that ratio to be more than 10 or so, provided that the liquidity\\n(volume) constraint described above is also satisﬁed. If the capital\\nweight of a stock is proportional to the fourth root of its market cap,\\nit would do the trick.\\nThere is one other way to reduce market impact. Many insti-\\ntutional traders who desire to execute a large order will break it\\ndown into many smaller orders and execute them over time. This\\nmethod of trading will certainly reduce market impact; however,\\nit engenders another kind of transactions costs, namely, slippage.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, slippage is the difference between the\\nprice that triggers the trading signal and the average execution price\\nof the entire order. Because the order is executed over a period\\nof time, slippage can be quite large. Since reducing market impact\\nin this way may increase slippage, it is not really suitable for retail\\ntraders whose order size is usually not big enough to require this\\nremedy.\\nSometimes, however, slippage is outside of your control: Per-\\nhaps your brokerage’s execution speed is simply too slow, due to\\neither software issues (their software processes your orders too\\nslowly), risk control issues (your order has to be checked against\\nyour account’s buying power and pass various risk control criteria\\nbefore it can be routed to the exchange), or pipeline issues (the bro-\\nkerage’s speed of access to the exchanges). Or perhaps your bro-\\nkerage does not have access to deep enough “dark-pool” liquidity.\\nThese execution costs and issues should affect your choice of bro-\\nkerages, as I pointed out in Chapter 4.'),\n",

If the backtest performance\\ncompletely fell apart after this exercise, chances are you do have\\nthis bias and it is time to look for a new strategy. If the backtest\\nperformance is still reasonable, your poor live trading performance\\nmay just be due to bad luck.\\nRegime shifts refer to the situation when the ﬁnancial market\\nstructure or the macroeconomic environment undergoes a drastic\\nchange so much so that trading strategies that were proﬁtable be-\\nfore may not be proﬁtable now.\\nThere are two noteworthy regime shifts in recent years re-\\nlated to market (or regulatory) structure that may affect certain\\nstrategies.\\nThe ﬁrst one is the decimalization of stock prices. Prior to early\\n2001, stock prices in the United States were quoted in multiples of\\none-sixteenth and one-eighteenth of a penny. Since April 9, 2001, all\\nU.S. stocks have been quoted in decimals. This seemingly innocuous\\nchange has had a dramatic impact on the market structure, which\\nis particularly negative for the proﬁtability of statistical arbitrage\\nstrategies.\\nThe reason for this may be worthy of a book unto itself. In a\\nnutshell, decimalization reduces frictions in the price discovery pro-\\ncess, while statistical arbitrageurs mostly act as market makers and\\nderive their proﬁts from frictions and inefﬁciencies in this process.\\n(This is the explanation given by Dr. Andrew Sterge in a Columbia\\nUniversity ﬁnancial engineering seminar titled “Where Have All the\\nStat Arb Proﬁts Gone?” in January 2008. Other industry practitioners\\nhave made the same point to me in private conversations.) Hence,\\nwe can expect backtest performance of statistical arbitrage strate-\\ngies prior to 2001 to be far superior to their present-day perfor-\\nmance.\\nThe other regime shift is relevant if your strategy shorts\\nstocks.'),\n",

This plus-tick rule\\nwas eliminated by the SEC in June 2007. Therefore, your backtest\\nresults for a strategy that shorts stocks may show an artiﬁcially in-\\nﬂated performance prior to 2007 relative to their actual realizable\\nperformance in those days.\\nActually, there is another problem with realizing the backtest\\nperformance of a strategy that shorts stocks apart from this regula-\\ntory regime shift. Even without the plus-tick rule, many stocks, es-\\npecially the small-cap ones or the ones with low liquidity, are “hard\\nto borrow.” For you to be able to short a stock, your broker has to\\nbe able to borrow it from someone else (usually a large mutual fund\\nor other brokerage clients) and lend it to you for selling.

Dr. Edward Thorp, whom I mentioned in the pref-\\nace, has written an excellent expository article on this subject in one\\nof his papers (Thorp, 1997), and I shall follow his discussion closely\\nin this chapter. (Dr. Thorp’s discussion is centered on a portfolio of\\nsecurities, and mine is constructed around a portfolio of strategies.\\nHowever, the mathematics are almost identical.)\\nEvery optimization problem begins with an objective. Our ob-\\njective here is to maximize our long-term wealth—an objective that\\nI believe is not controversial for the individual investor. Maximiz-\\ning long-term wealth is equivalent to maximizing the long-term com-\\npounded growth rateg of your portfolio. Note that this objective im-\\nplicitly means that ruin (i.e., equity’s going to zero or less because of\\na loss) must be avoided. This is because if ruin can be reached with\\nnonzero probability at some point, the long-term wealth is surely\\nzero, as is the long-term growth rate.\\n(In all of the discussions, I assume that we reinvest all trading\\nproﬁts, and therefore it is the levered, compounded growth rate that\\nis of ultimate importance.)\\nOne approximation that I will make is that the probability dis-\\ntribution of the returns of each of the trading strategyi is Gaussian,\\nwith a ﬁxed meanmi and standard deviationsi. (The returns should\\nbe net of all ﬁnancing costs; that is, they should be excess returns.)\\nThis is a common approximation in ﬁnance, but it can be quite\\ninaccurate. Certain big losses in the ﬁnancial markets occur with\\nfar higher frequencies (or viewed alternatively, at far higher magni-\\ntudes) than Gaussian probability distributions will allow. However,\\nevery scientiﬁc or engineering endeavor starts with the simplest\\nmodel with the crudest approximation, and ﬁnance is no excep-\\ntion. I will discuss the remedies to such inaccuracies later in this\\nchapter.\\nLet’s denote the optimal fractions of your equity that you should\\nallocate to each of yourn strategies by a column vectorF∗ = ( f ∗\\n1 ,\\nf ∗\\n2 ,..., f ∗\\nn )T.

Here is the simple mathematical embodiment\\nof this fact.\\nExample 6.2: Calculating the Optimal Leverage Based on the\\nKelly Formula\\nLet’s see an example of the Kelly formula at work. Suppose our portfolio\\nconsists of just a long position in SPY, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) track-\\ning the S&P 500 index. Let’s suppose that the mean annual return of SPY is\\n11.23 percent, with an annualized standard deviation of 16.91 percent, and\\nthat the risk-free rate is 4 percent. Hence, the portfolio has an annual mean\\nexcess return of 7.231 percent and an annual standard deviation of 16.91\\npercent, giving it a Sharpe ratio of 0.4275. The optimal leverage according\\nto the Kelly formula is f = 0.07231/0.16912 = 2.528. (Notice one inter-\\nesting tidbit: The Kelly f is independent of time scale, so it actually does\\nnot matter whether you annualize your return and standard deviation, as\\nopposed to Sharpe ratio which is time scale dependent.) Finally, the annu-\\nalized compounded, levered growth rate is 13.14 percent, which includes\\nthe ﬁnancing costs.\\nYou can verify these numbers yourselves by downloading the SPY daily\\nprices from Yahoo! Finance and computing the various quantities on a\\nspreadsheet. I did that on December 29, 2007, and my spreadsheet is avail-\\nable at epchan.com/book/example6 2.xls. In column H, I have computed\\nthe daily returns of the (adjusted) closing prices of SPY, while in row 3760\\nstarting at column H, I have computed the (annualized) mean return of\\nSPY, the standard deviation of SPY, the mean excess return of the portfo-\\nlio, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, the Kelly leverage, and, ﬁnally, the\\ncompounded growth rate.\\nThe Kelly leverage of 2.528 that we computed is saying that, for this\\nstrategy, if you have $100,000 in cash to invest, and if you really be-\\nlieve the expected values of your returns and standard deviations, you\\nshould borrow money to buy $252,800 worth of SPY. Furthermore, ex-\\npect an annual compounded return on your $100,000 investment to be\\n13.14 percent.\\nFor comparison, let’s see what compounded growth rate we will get if\\nwe did not leverage our investment (see the formula in the appendix to this\\nchapter): g = r + m− s2/2 = 0.1123 − (0.1691)2/2 = 9.8 percent. This, and\\nnot mean annual return of 11.23 percent, is the long-term growth rate of\\nbuying SPY with cash only.'),\n",

Because the optimal leverage of 2.528 times the current equity\\nof $74,720 is $188,892.\\nAs a practical procedure, this continuous updating of the capi-\\ntal allocation should occur at least once at the end of each trading\\nday. In addition to updating the capital allocation, one should also\\nperiodically update F* itself by recalculating the most recent trail-\\ning mean return and standard deviation.

If you hold your positions for only one day or so, then as a\\nrule of thumb, I would advise using a lookback period of six months.\\nUsing a relatively short lookback period has the advantage of allow-\\ning you to gradually reduce your exposure to strategies that have\\nbeen losing their performance. As for the frequency of update, it\\nshould not be a burden to updateF* daily once you have written a\\nprogram to do so.\\nOne last point: Some strategies generate a variable number of\\ntrading signals each day, which may result in a variable number of\\npositions and thus total capital each day. How should the Kelly for-\\nmula be used to determine the capital in this case when we don’t\\nknow what it will be beforehand?

In fact, the\\nSPY example (6.2) illustrated that the Kelly formula would advise\\nyou to reduce the portfolio size in the face of trading losses.

(The other face of the coin is that optimal leverage dic-\\ntates that you should increase your position size when your strategy\\ngenerates proﬁts.) This kind of selling is believed by some analysts\\nto be the cause of “ﬁnancial contagion” affecting many large hedge\\nfunds simultaneously when one faces a large loss.\\nAn example of this is the summer 2007 meltdown, described in\\nthe previously cited article “What Happened to the Quants in Au-\\ngust 2007?” by Amir Khandani and Andrew Lo. During August 2007,\\nunder the ominous cloud of a housing and mortgage default crisis,\\na number of well-known hedge funds experienced unprecedented\\nlosses, with Goldman Sachs’s Global Alpha fund falling 22.5 per-\\ncent. Several billion dollars evaporated within all of one week. Even\\nRenaissance Technologies Corporation, arguably the most success-\\nful quantitative hedge fund of all time, lost 8.7 percent in the ﬁrst\\nhalf of August, though it later recovered most of it. Not only is the\\nmagnitude of the loss astounding, but the widespread nature of it\\nwas causing great concern in the ﬁnancial community. Strangest of\\nall, few of these funds hold any mortgage-backed securities at all,\\nostensibly the root cause of the panic. It therefore became a classic\\nstudy of ﬁnancial contagion as propagated by hedge funds.\\nThis kind of contagion occurs because a large loss by one hedge\\nfund causes it to sell off some large positions that it holds (whether\\nor not these are the positions that cause the loss in the ﬁrst place).\\nThis selling causes the prices of the securities to drop (or rise in\\nthe case of short positions). If other hedge funds are holding sim-\\nilar positions, they will then suffer large losses also, causing their\\nown risk management system to sell off their own positions, and on\\nand on. For example, in the summer of 2007, one large hedge fund\\nmight have been holding subprime mortgage-backed securities and\\nsuffered a large loss in that sector. Risk management then required\\nthat it sold off liquid stock positions in their portfolio which might,\\nup to that point, be unaffected by the subprime debacle. Because of\\nthe selling of such stock positions, other statistical arbitrage hedge\\nfunds that hold no mortgage-backed securities might now suffered\\nbig losses, and proceeded to sell their stocks as well.

A lower leverage\\nimplies a smaller size of the selling required for risk management.\\nSometimes, even taking the conservative half-Kelly formula may\\nbe too aggressive, and traders may want to limit their portfolio\\nsize further by additional constraints. This is because, as I pointed\\nout previously, the application of the Kelly formula to continuous\\nﬁnance is premised on the assumption that return distribution is\\nGaussian. (Finance is continuous in the sense that the outcomes of\\nmaking bets in the ﬁnancial market fall on a continuum of proﬁts or\\nlosses, as opposed to a game of cards where the outcomes fall into\\ndiscrete cases.) But, of course, the returns are not really Gaussian:\\nlarge losses occur at far higher frequencies than would be predicted\\nby a nice bell-shaped curve. Some people refer to the true distri-\\nbutions of returns as having “fat tails.” What this means is that the\\nprobability of an event far, far away from the mean is much higher\\nthan allowed by the Gaussian bell curve. These highly improbable\\nevents have been called “black swan” events by the author Nassim\\nTaleb (see Taleb, 2007).\\nTo handle extreme events that fall outside the Gaussian distri-\\nbution, we can use our simple backtest technique to roughly esti-\\nmate what the maximum one-period loss was historically. (The pe-\\nriod may be one week, one day, or one hour. The only criterion to\\nuse is that you should be ready to rebalance your portfolio accord-\\ning to the Kelly formula at the end of every period.) You should also\\nhave in mind what is the maximum one-period drawdown on your\\nequity that you are willing to suffer. Dividing the maximum tolera-\\nble one-period drawdown on equity by the maximum historical loss\\nwill tell you whether even half-Kelly leverage is too large for your\\ncomfort. The leverage to use is always the smaller of the half-Kelly\\nleverage and the maximum leverage obtained using the worst histor-\\nical loss.

Meanwhile, the leverage\\nrecommended by half-Kelly is 1.26. Hence, in this case, even half-\\nKelly leverage wouldnot be conservative enough to survive Black\\nMonday.\\nThe truly scary scenario in risk management is the one that\\nhas not occurred in history before. Echoing the philosopher Lud-\\nwig Wittgenstein, “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be\\nsilent”—on such unknowables, theoretical models are appropriately\\nsilent.\\nIS THE USE OF STOP LOSS A GOOD RISK\\nMANAGEMENT PRACTICE?\\nSome traders believe that good risk management means imposing stop loss on\\nevery trade; that is, if a position incurs a certain percent loss, the trader will\\nexit the position. It is a common fallacy to believe that imposing stop loss will\\nprevent the portfolio from suﬀering catastrophic losses. When a catastrophic\\nevent occurs, securities prices will drop discontinuously, so the stop loss orders\\nto exit the positions will only be ﬁlled at prices much worse than those before\\nthe event. So, by exiting the positions, we are actually realizing the catastrophic\\nloss and not avoiding it. For stop loss to be beneﬁcial, we must believe that we\\nare in a momentum, or trending, regime. In other words, we must believe that\\nthe prices will get worse within the expected lifetime of our trade. Otherwise, if\\nthe market is mean reverting within that lifetime, we will eventually recoup our\\nlosses if we didn’t exit the position too quickly.\\nOf course, it is not easy to tell whether one is in a momentum regime (when\\nstop loss is beneﬁcial) or in a mean-reverting regime (when stop loss is harm-\\nful). My own observation is that when the movement of prices is due to news\\nor other fundamental reasons (such as a company’s deteriorating revenue), one\\nis likely to be in a momentum regime, and one should not “stand in front of\\na freight train,” in traders’ vernacular. For example, if a fundamental analysis\\nof a company reveals that it is currently overvalued, its stock price will likely\\ngradually decrease (at least in relation to the market index) in order to reach\\na new, lower equilibrium price. This movement to the lower equilibrium price\\nis irreversible as long as the fundamental economics of the company does not\\nchange. However, when securities prices move drastically without any apparent\\nnews or reasons, it is likely that the move is the result of a liquidity event—for\\nexample, major holders of the securities suddenly need to liquidate large'),\n",

It could be wrong for a large number of\\nreasons, some of which were detailed in Chapter 3: data-snooping\\nbias, survivorship bias, and so on. To eliminate all these different\\nbiases and errors in the backtest programs, it is extremely helpful to\\nhave a collaborator or consultant to duplicate your backtest results\\nindependently to ensure their validity. This need to duplicate results\\nis routinely done in scientiﬁc research and is no less essential in\\nﬁnancial research.\\nModel risk can also come not from any bias or error in your\\nmodel or backtesting procedure, but from increased competition\\nfrom other institutional traders all running the same strategy as\\nyou; or it could be a result of some fundamental change in market\\nstructure that eliminated the edge of your trading model. This is the\\nregime shift that I talked about in Chapter 5.\\nThere is not much you can do to alleviate these sources of model\\nrisk, except to gradually lower the leverage of the model as it racks\\nup losses, up to the point where the leverage is zero. This can be ac-\\ncomplished in a systematic way if you constantly update the lever-\\nage according to the Kelly formula based on the trailing mean return\\nand standard deviation. (As the mean return decreases to zero in the\\nlookback period, your Kelly leverage will be driven to zero.)

I will try to highlight a few of the common irrational behav-\\niors that affect trading.\\nThe ﬁrst behavioral bias is known variously as theendowment\\neffect, status quo bias,o rloss aversion.

As I argued in the risk management section, there\\nare rational reasons to hold on to a losing position (e.g., when you\\nexpect mean-reverting behavior); however, these behavioral biases\\ncause traders to hold on to losing positions even when there is no\\nrational reason (e.g., when you expect trending behavior, and the\\ntrend is such that your positions will lose even more). At the same\\ntime, the loss aversion bias causes some traders to exit their prof-\\nitable positions too soon, even if holding longer will lead to a larger\\nproﬁt on average. Why do they exit the proﬁtable positions so soon?\\nBecause the pain from possibly losing some of the current proﬁts\\noutweighs the pleasure from gaining higher proﬁts.\\nThis behavioral bias manifests itself most clearly and most dis-\\nastrously when one has entered a position by mistake (because of\\neither a software bug, an operational error, or a data problem) and\\nhas incurred a big loss. The rational step to take is to exit the po-\\nsition immediately upon discovery of the error. However, traders\\nare often tempted to wait for mean reversion such that the loss is\\nsmaller before they exit. Unless you have a model for mean rever-\\nsion that suggests now is a good time to enter into this position,\\nthis wait for mean reversion may very well lead to bigger losses\\ninstead.\\nAnother common bias that I have personally experienced is the\\n“representativeness bias”—people tend to put too much weight on\\nrecent experience and underweight long-term average (Ritter, 2003).\\n(This reference has a good introduction to various biases studied\\nby behavioral ﬁnance.) After a big loss, traders—even quantitative\\ntraders—tend to immediately modify certain parameters of their\\nstrategies so that they would have avoided the big loss if they were\\nto trade this modiﬁed system. But, of course, this is unwise because\\nthis modiﬁcation may invite some other big loss that is yet to hap-\\npen, or it may have eliminated many proﬁt opportunities that ex-\\nisted. We must remember that we are operating in a probabilistic\\nregime: No system can avoid all the market vagaries that can result\\nin losses.\\nIf you feel that your system really is deﬁcient and want to tweak\\nit, you should always backtest the modiﬁed version to make sure'),\n",

Many traders (and their managers, investors, etc.) will\\nbe under great pressure under this circumstance to shut down the\\nmodel completely. Other overly self-conﬁdent traders with a reck-\\nless bent will do the opposite: They will double their bets on their\\nlosing models, hoping to recoup their losses eventually, if and when\\nthe models rebound. Neither behavior is rational: if you have been\\nmanaging your capital allocation and leverage by the Kelly for-\\nmula, you would lower the capital allocation for the losing model\\ngradually.\\nGreed is the more usual emotion when the model is having a\\ngood run and is generating a lot of proﬁts. The temptation now is to\\nincrease its leverage quickly in order to get rich quickly. Once again,\\na well-disciplined quantitative trader will keep the leverage below\\nthe dictates of the Kelly formula as well as the caution imposed by\\nthe possibility of fat-tail events.\\nBoth despair and greed can lead to overleveraging (i.e., trad-\\ning an overly large portfolio): In despair, one tries to recoup the\\nlosses by adding fresh capital; in greed, one adds capital too\\nquickly after initial successes with a strategy. Therefore, the one\\ngolden rule in risk management is to keep the size of your port-\\nfolio under control at all times. This is, however, easier said than\\ndone. Large, well-known funds have succumbed to the tempta-\\ntion to overleverage and failed: Long-Term Capital Management in\\n2000 (Lowenstein, 2000) and Amaranth Advisors in 2006 (epchan.\\nblogspot.com/2006/10/highly-improbable-event.html). In the Ama-\\nranth Advisors case, the leverage employed on one single strategy\\n(natural gas calendar spread trade) due to one single trader (Brian\\nHunter) is so large that a $6 billion dollar loss was incurred, com-\\nfortably wiping out the fund’s equity—a textbook case of risk mis-\\nmanagement.\\nI have experienced this pressure myself both in an institutional\\nsetting and in a personal setting, and the unfortunate result both'),\n",

The ultimate risk management\\nmind-set is very simple: Do not succumb to either despair or greed.\\nTo gain practice in this psychological discipline, one must proceed\\nslowly with small position size, and thoroughly test various aspects\\nof the trading business (model, software, operational procedure,\\nmoney and risk management) before scaling up according to the\\nKelly formula.\\nI have found that in order to proceed slowly and cautiously, it\\nis helpful to have other sources of income or other businesses to\\nhelp sustain yourself either ﬁnancially or emotionally (to avoid the\\nboredom associated with slow progress).

Otherwise, they are random-\\nwalking, and trading will be futile. If you believe that prices are mean\\nreverting and that they are currently low relative to some reference\\nprice, you should buy now and plan to sell higher later. However, if\\nyou believe the prices are trending and that they are currently low,\\nyou should (short) sell now and plan to buy at an even lower price\\nlater. The opposite is true if you believe prices are high.\\nAcademic research has indicated that stock prices areon av-\\nerage very close to random walking. However, this does not mean\\nthat under certain special conditions, they cannot exhibit some de-\\ngree of mean reversion or trending behavior. Furthermore, at any\\ngiven time, stock prices can be both mean reverting and trending\\ndepending on the time horizon you are interested in. Constructing a\\ntrading strategy is essentially a matter of determining if the prices\\nunder certain conditions and for a certain time horizon will be mean\\nreverting or trending, and what the initial reference price should be\\nat any given time. (When the prices are trending, they are also said\\nto have “momentum,” and thus the corresponding trading strategy\\nis often called amomentum strategy.)\\nSome people like to describe the phenomenon that prices can\\nbe both mean reverting and trending at the same time as the “frac-\\ntal” nature of stock prices. Technical analysts or chartists like to\\nuse the so-called Elliott wave theory to analyze such phenomena.\\nStill others like to use the discipline of machine learning or artiﬁ-\\ncial intelligence (in particular, techniques such as hidden Markov\\nmodels, Kalman ﬁlter, neural networks, etc.) to discover whether\\nthe prices are in a mean-reverting or trending “regime.” I person-\\nally have not found such general theories of mean reversion or mo-\\nmentum particularly useful. (See, however, the section on regime\\nswitching, which describes an apparently successful attempt to pre-\\ndict regime switch for one particular stock.) Rather, I ﬁnd it is usu-\\nally safe to assume that, unless the expected earnings of a company'),\n",

In fact, ﬁnancial\\nresearchers (Khandani and Lo, 2007) have constructed a very simple\\nshort-term mean reversal model that is proﬁtable (before transac-\\ntion costs) over many years. Of course, whether the mean reversion\\nis strong enough and consistent enough such that we can trade prof-\\nitably after factoring in transaction costs is another matter, and it is\\nup to you, the trader, to ﬁnd those special circumstances when it is\\nstrong and consistent.\\nThough mean reversion is quite prevalent, backtesting a prof-\\nitable mean-reverting strategy can be quite perilous.\\nMany historical ﬁnancial databases contain errors in price\\nquotes. Any such error tends to artiﬁcially inﬂate the performance\\nof mean-reverting strategies. It is easy to see why: a mean-reverting\\nstrategy will buy on a ﬁctitious quote that is much lower than some\\nmoving average and sell on the next correct quote that is in line with\\nthe moving average and thus makes a proﬁt. One must make sure the\\ndata is thoroughly cleansed of such ﬁctitious quotes before one can\\ncompletely trust your backtesting performance on a mean-reverting\\nstrategy.\\nSurvivorship bias also affects the backtesting of mean-reverting\\nstrategies disproportionately, as I discussed in Chapter 3. Stocks\\nthat went through extreme price actions are likely to be either ac-\\nquired (the prices went very high) or went bankrupt (the prices\\nwent to zeros). A mean-reverting strategy will short the former and\\nbuy the latter, losing money in both cases. However, these stocks\\nmay not appear at all in your historical database if it has survivor-\\nship bias, thus artiﬁcially inﬂating your backtest performance. You\\ncan look up Table 3.1 to ﬁnd out which database has survivor-\\nship bias.\\nMomentum can be generated by the slow diffusion of\\ninformation—as more people become aware of certain news, more\\npeople decide to buy or sell a stock, thereby driving the price in\\nthe same direction. I suggested earlier that stock prices may ex-\\nhibit momentum when the expected earnings have changed. This\\ncan happen when a company announces its quarterly earnings, and\\ninvestors either gradually become aware of this announcement or'),\n",

And indeed, this leads to\\na momentum strategy calledpost earnings announcement drift,or\\nPEAD. (For a particularly useful article with lots of references on\\nthis strategy, look up quantlogic.blogspot.com/2006/03/pocket-phd-\\npost-earning-announcment.html.) Essentially, this strategy recom-\\nmends that you buy a stock when its earnings exceed expectations,\\nand short a stock when it falls short. More generally, many news an-\\nnouncements have the potential of altering expectations of a stock’s\\nfuture earnings, and therefore have the potential to trigger a trend-\\ning period. As to what kind of news will trigger this, and how long\\nthe trending period will last, it is again up to you to ﬁnd out.\\nBesides the slow diffusion of information, momentum can be\\ncaused by the incremental execution of a large order due to the li-\\nquidity needs or private investment decisions of a large investor.\\nThis cause probably accounts for more instances of short-term mo-\\nmentum than any other causes. With the advent of increasingly so-\\nphisticated execution algorithms adopted by the large brokerages, it\\nis, however, increasingly difﬁcult to ascertain whether a large order\\nis behind the observed momentum.\\nMomentum can also be generated by the herdlike behavior of in-\\nvestors: investors interpret the (possibly random and meaningless)\\nbuying or selling decisions of others as the sole justiﬁcations of their\\nown trading decisions. As Yale economist Robert Schiller said in the\\nNew York Times(Schiller, 2008), nobody has all the information\\nthey need in order to make a fully informed ﬁnancial decision. One\\nhas to rely on the judgment of others. There is, however, no sure\\nway to discern the quality of the judgment of others. More problem-\\natically, people make their ﬁnancial decisions at different times, not\\nmeeting at a town hall and reaching a consensus once and for all.\\nThe ﬁrst person who paid a high price for a house is “informing”\\nthe others that houses are good investments, which leads another\\nperson to make the same decision, and so on. Thus, a possibly erro-\\nneous decision by the ﬁrst buyer is propagated as “information” to a\\nherd of others.\\nUnfortunately, momentum regimes generated by these two\\ncauses (private liquidity needs and herdlike behavior) have highly'),\n",

What are the effects\\nof increasing competition from traders with the same strategies?\\nFor mean-reverting strategies, the effect typically is the gradual\\nelimination of any arbitrage opportunity, and thus gradually dimin-\\nishing returns down to zero. When the number of arbitrage op-\\nportunities has been reduced to almost zero, the mean-reverting\\nstrategy is subject to the risk that an increasing percentage of\\ntrading signals are actually due to fundamental changes in stocks’\\nvaluation and thus is not going to mean revert. For momentum\\nstrategies, the effect of competition is often the diminishing of the\\ntime horizon over which the trend will continue. As news dissem-\\ninates at a faster rate and as more traders take advantage of this\\ntrend earlier on, the equilibrium price will be reached sooner. Any\\ntrade entered after this equilibrium price is reached will be unprof-\\nitable.\\nREGIME SWITCHING*\\nThe concept of regimes is most basic to ﬁnancial markets.

If only\\nit were that easy. The difﬁculty with predicting this type of switch-\\ning encourages researchers to look more broadly at other types of\\nregime switching in the ﬁnancial markets, hoping to ﬁnd some that\\nmay be more amenable to existing statistical tools.\\nI have already described two regime switches (or “shifts,” for\\nthese two examples did not switch back to their former regimes)\\nthat are due to changes in market and regulatory structures: deci-\\nmalization of stock prices in 2003 and the elimination of the short-\\nsale plus-tick rule in 2007. (See Chapter 5 for details.) These regime\\nshifts are preannounced by the government, so no predictions of\\nthe shifts are necessary, though few people can predict the exact\\nconsequences of the regulatory changes.\\nSome of the other most common ﬁnancial or economic regimes\\nstudied are inﬂationary vs. recessionary regimes, high- vs. low-\\nvolatility regimes, and mean-reverting vs. trending regimes. Among\\nthese, volatility regime switching seems to be most amenable to\\nclassical econometric tools such as the generalized autoregres-\\nsive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model (See Klaassen,\\n2002). That is not surprising, as there is a long history of success\\namong ﬁnancial economists in modeling volatilities as opposed to\\nthe underlying stock prices themselves. While such predictions of\\nvolatility regime switches can be of great value to options traders,\\nthey are unfortunately of no help to stock traders.\\nAcademic attempts to model regime switches in stock prices\\ngenerally proceed along these lines:\\n1. Propose that the two (or more) regimes are characterized by\\ndifferent probability distributions of the prices. In the simplest\\ncases, the log of the prices of both regimes may be represented\\nby normal distributions, except that they have different means\\nand/or standard deviations.\\n2. Assume that there is some kind of transition probability among\\nthe regimes.\\n3.

Based on the ﬁtted model above, ﬁnd out the expected regime\\nof the next time step and, more importantly, the expected stock\\nprice.\\nThis type of approach is usually calledMarkov regime switch-\\ning or hidden Markov models, and it is generally based on a\\nBayesian probabilistic framework. Readers who are interested in\\nreading more about some of these approaches may peruse Nielsen\\nand Olesen (2000), van Norden and Schaller (1993), or Kaufmann\\nand Scheicher (1996).\\nDespite the elegant theoretical framework, such Markov regime-\\nswitching models are generally useless for actual trading purposes.\\nThe reason for this weakness is that they assume constant tran-\\nsition probabilities among regimes at all times. In practice, this\\nmeans that at any time (as illustrated by the Nielsen and Olesen pa-\\nper), there is always a very small probability for the stock to tran-\\nsition from a normal, quiescent regime to a volatile regime. But this\\nis useless to traders who want to know when—and under what pre-\\ncise conditions—the transition probability will suddenly peak. This\\nquestion is tackled by the turning points models.\\nTurning points models take a data mining approach (Chai, 2007):\\nEnter all possible variables that might predict a turning point or\\nregime switch. Variables such as current volatility; last-period re-\\nturn; or changes in macroeconomic numbers such as consumer con-\\nﬁdence, oil price changes, bond price changes, and so on can all\\nbe part of this input. In fact, in a very topical article about turning\\npoints in the real estate market by economist Robert Schiller (2007),\\nit was suggested that the crescendo of media chatter about impend-\\ning boom or bust may actually be a good predictor of a coming turn-\\ning point.\\nIn Example 7.1, I illustrate how we might detect turning points\\nusing a data-mining approach with just simple technical indicators\\nbuilt on stock price series as inputs while using stock returns of\\nmultiple holding periods as outputs.'),\n",

This is nor-\\nmally a very onerous task, even with MATLAB. But, luckily, a recent machine\\nlearning program has enabled this discovery process to be done in a matter\\nof hours.\\nI shall employ a tool here called Alphacet Discovery, which is an inte-\\ngrated backtesting and execution platform recently launched by Alphacet,\\nInc. (www.alphacet.com. Full disclosure: Alphacet is a client of my ﬁrm.)\\nThis platform not only integrates all historical and real-time data needed\\nfor rapid strategy prototyping, backtesting, analysis, and real-time deploy-\\nment; it also contains an expanding array of machine learning programs\\nsuch as neural networks and genetic algorithms that are well suited to data\\nmining for the kind of relationships we are seeking.\\nI will pick a prominent brokerage stock—GS—as a proxy for the ﬁnan-\\ncial sector. My objective is to ﬁnd out if I can detect turning points in this\\nsector where it goes from bull to bear and back. My initial hypothesis is that\\nmajor shifts of interest rates, a release of government macroeconomic data,\\nor earnings announcements are likely triggers of turning points. At the time\\nof this writing, Alphacet had not yet completed integration of macroeco-\\nnomic or company news data into its database, so I will use a large percent\\nchange in GS as proxy for such news releases. Furthermore, I believe that\\nwhenever GS reaches an N-day high or low just before this large drop or\\nrise in prices occurs is a good signal that a previous regime is close to an\\nend. So I shall use this condition as an additional input as well.\\nThe search problem we face is: How large a percent change is suﬃcient\\nto trigger a regime switch? What should N be in the N-day high/low con-\\ndition? And how long does the new regime generally last? (In other words,\\nwhat is the optimal holding period?) To answer these questions in the old-\\nfashioned, manual way is very time consuming, as one has to run multi-\\nple simulations with diﬀerent thresholds for the independent variables and\\nmultiple return horizons for the dependent variables. Let’s see if Alphacet\\nDiscovery can help us automate this process.\\nThe independent variables of the model are just the one-day returns\\nof GS. The dependent variables are the future returns of GS within various\\nholding periods. Discovery can easily ﬁnd an optimal rule, or an optimal\\ncombination of rules, which will lead to the best backtest performance. In\\nour case, each percent-change threshold can be encapsulated as a rule. I\\nentered two thresholds for buys and two for shorts:−1p e r c e n t ,−3p e r c e n t ,'),\n",

However, the converse is\\nnot true. You don’t necessarily need a stationary price series in order\\nto have a successful mean-reverting strategy. Even a nonstationary\\nprice series can have many short-term reversal opportunities that\\none can exploit, as many traders have discovered.\\nMany pair traders are unfamiliar with the concepts of station-\\narity and cointegration. But most of them are familiar withcorrela-\\ntion, which superﬁcially seems to mean the same thing as cointe-\\ngration. Actually, they are quite different. Correlation between two\\nprice series actually refers to the correlations of their returns over\\nsome time horizon (for concreteness, let’s say a day). If two stocks\\nare positively correlated, there is a good chance that their prices\\nwill move in the same direction most days. However, having a posi-\\ntive correlation does not say anything about the long-term behavior\\nof the two stocks. In particular, it doesn’t guarantee that the stock\\nprices will not grow farther and farther apart in the long run even\\nif they do move in the same direction most days. However, if two\\nstocks were cointegrated and remain so in the future, their prices\\n(weighted appropriately) will be unlikely to diverge. Yet their daily\\n(or weekly, or any other time horizon) returns may be quite uncor-\\nrelated.\\nAs an artiﬁcial example of two stocks, A and B, that are coin-\\ntegrated but not correlated, see Figure 7.6. Stock B clearly doesn’t\\nmove in any correlated fashion with stock A: Some days they move\\nin the same direction, other days the opposite. Most days, stock B\\ndoesn’t move at all. But notice that the spread in stock prices be-\\ntween A and B always returns to about $1 after a while.\\nCan we ﬁnd real-life example of this phenomenon? Well, KO\\nversus PEP is one. In the program example7 3.m I have shown\\nthat they do not cointegrate. If, however, you test their daily re-\\nturns for correlation, you will ﬁnd that their correlation of 0.4849\\nis indeed statistically signiﬁcant. The correlation test is presented\\nat the end of the example7 3.m program and shown here in\\nExample 7.3.'),\n",

(Every one of these quantities is time dependent,\\nbut I suppress this explicit dependence for simplicity.)\\nThe terms factor exposure, factor return,a n dspeciﬁc return\\nare commonly used in quantitative ﬁnance, and it is well worth our\\neffort to understand their meanings. Factor returns are the com-\\nmon drivers of stock returns, and are therefore independent of a\\nparticular stock. Factor exposures are the sensitivities to each of\\nthese common drivers. Any part of a stock’s return that cannot be\\nexplained by these common factor returns is deemed a speciﬁc re-\\nturn (i.e., speciﬁc to a stock and essentially regarded as just random\\nnoise within the APT framework). Each stock’s speciﬁc return is as-\\nsumed to be uncorrelated to another stock’s.\\nLet’s illustrate these using a simple factor model called the\\nFama-French Three-Factor model (Fama and French, 1992). This\\nmodel postulates that the excess return of a stock depends linearly\\non only three factor exposures: its beta (i.e., its sensitivity to the\\nmarket index), its market capitalization, and its book-to-price ratio.\\nThese factor exposures are obviously different for each stock and\\nfor each time period. (Factor exposures are often normalized such\\nthat the average of the factor exposures within a universe of stocks\\nis zero, and the standard deviation is 1.)\\nNow that we know how to calculate the factor exposures, what\\nabout the factor returns and speciﬁc returns? We cannot directly\\ncompute the factor returns and speciﬁc returns—we have to infer\\ntheir values by running a multivariate linear regression of the excess\\nreturns of stocks against the factor exposures. Note that each stock\\nrepresents one data point in this linear regression, and we have to\\neither run a separate linear regression for each time period or, if\\nwe want an average value over many time periods, aggregate the\\nvalues from all these time periods into one training set and run one\\nregression against them all.\\nIf you perform this linear regression ﬁt over many time peri-\\nods for the Fama-French Three-Factor model, you will ﬁnd that\\nthe market capitalization factor return is usually negative (meaning'),\n",

And since most stocks\\nare positively correlated with the market index, the beta factor re-\\nturn is positive as well.\\nThe Fama-French model has no monopoly on the choice of\\nfactors. In fact, you can construct as many factors as creativity\\nand rationality allow. For example, you can choose return on eq-\\nuity as a factor exposure, or the correlation of the stock return\\nwith the prime rate as another. You can choose any number of\\nother economic, fundamental, or technical factors. Whether the\\nfactor exposures you have chosen are sensible or not will deter-\\nmine whether the factor model explains the excess returns of the\\nstocks adequately. If the factor exposures (and consequently the\\nmodel as a whole) are poorly chosen, the linear regression ﬁt will\\nproduce speciﬁc returns of signiﬁcant sizes, and the R2 statistic\\nof the ﬁt will be small. According to experts (Grinold and Kahn,\\n1999), the R2 statistic of a good factor model with monthly re-\\nturns of 1,000 stocks and 50 factors is typically about 30 percent to\\n40 percent.\\nIt may appear that these factor models are only explanatory in\\nretrospect—that is, given historical returns and factor exposures,\\nwe can compute the factor returns of those historical periods. But\\nwhat good are those historical factor returns for our trading? It turns\\nout that often factor returns are more stable than individual stock\\nreturns. In other words, they havemomentum. You can therefore\\nassume that their values remain unchanged from the current period\\n(known from the regression ﬁt) to the next time period. If this is\\nthe case, then, of course, you can also predict the excess returns,\\nas long as the factor exposures are well chosen and therefore the\\ntime-varying speciﬁc returns are not signiﬁcant.\\nLet me clarify one point of potential confusion. Even though\\nI stated that factor models can be useful as a predictive model\\n(and therefore for trading) only if we assume the factor returns\\nhave momentum, it does not mean that factor models cannot cap-\\nture mean reversion of stock returns.

To obtain historical values of these factor\\nexposures for a large portfolio of stocks so as to backtest a factor model\\nis usually quite expensive and not very practical to an independent trader.\\n(For those who are ﬁscally prepared to purchase such data, see the list in\\nthe main text.) However, there is one kind of factor model that relies on\\nnothing more than historical returns to construct. This method is the so-\\ncalled principal component analysis (PCA).\\nIf we use PCA to construct the factor exposures and factor returns, we\\nmust assume that the factor exposures are constant (time independent)\\nover the estimation period. (This rules out factors that represent mean re-\\nversion or momentum, since these factor exposures depend on the prior\\nperiod returns.) More importantly, we assume that the factor returns are\\nuncorrelated; that is to say, their covariance matrix ⟨bbT ⟩ is diagonal.

As The Economist\\nnoted, one reason growth stocks were back in favor in 2007 is the\\nsimple fact that their price premium over value stocks has narrowed\\nsigniﬁcantly (Economist,2007b). Another reason is that as the U.S.\\neconomy slowed, investors increasingly opted for companies that\\nstill managed to generate increasing earnings instead of those that\\nwere hurt by the recessionary economy.\\nTherefore, it is not uncommon for factor models to experi-\\nence steep drawdown during the times when investors’ valuation\\nmethod shifts, even if only for a short duration.

They\\nare based on one of these:\\nr A ﬁxed holding period\\nr A target price or proﬁt cap\\nr The latest entry signals\\nr As t o pp r i c e\\nA ﬁxed holding period is the default exit strategy for any trad-\\ning strategy, whether it is a momentum model, a reversal model, or\\nsome kind of seasonal trading strategy, which can be either momen-\\ntum or reversal based. (More on this later.) I said before that one of\\nthe ways momentum is generated is the slow diffusion of informa-\\ntion. In this case, the process has a ﬁnite lifetime. The average value\\nof this ﬁnite lifetime determines the optimal holding period, which\\ncan usually be discovered in a backtest.\\nOne word of caution on determining the optimal holding period\\nof a momentum model: As I said before, this optimal period typically\\ndecreases due to the increasing speed of the diffusion of information\\nand the increasing number of traders who catch on to this trading\\nopportunity. Hence, a momentum model that has worked well with a\\nholding period equal to a week in the backtest period may work only\\nwith a one-day holding period now. Worse, the whole strategy may\\nbecome unproﬁtable a year into the future. Also, using a backtest of\\nthe trading strategy to determine holding period can be fraught with\\ndata-snooping bias, since the number of historical trades may be\\nlimited. Unfortunately, for a momentum strategy where the trades\\nare triggered by news or events, there are no other alternatives. For\\na mean-reverting strategy, however, there is a more statistically ro-\\nbust way to determine the optimal holding period that does not de-\\npend on the limited number of actual trades.\\nThe mean reversion of a time series can be modeled by an\\nequation called the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck formula (Unlenbeck, 1930).\\nLet’s say we denote the mean-reverting spread (long market value'),\n",

However, rather than imposing an ar-\\nbitrary stop-loss price and thus introducing an extra adjustable pa-\\nrameter, which invites data-snooping bias, exiting based on the most\\nrecent entry signal is clearly justiﬁed based on the rationale for the\\nmomentum model.\\nConsider a parallel situation when we are running a reversal\\nmodel. If an existing position has incurred a loss, running the re-\\nversal model again will simply generate a new signal with the same\\nsign. Thus, a reversal model for entry signals will never recommend\\na stop loss. (On the contrary, it can recommend a target price or\\nproﬁt cap when the reversal has gone so far as to hit the opposite\\nentry threshold.) And, indeed, it is much more reasonable to exit\\na position recommended by a mean-reversal model based on hold-\\ning period or proﬁt cap than stop loss, as a stop loss in this case\\noften means you are exiting at the worst possible time.

These strategies have been applied to both equity and\\ncommodity futures markets. However, from my own experience,\\nmuch of the seasonality in equity markets has weakened or even\\ndisappeared in recent years, perhaps due to the widespread knowl-\\nedge of this trading opportunity, whereas some seasonal trades in\\ncommodity futures are still proﬁtable.\\nThe most famous seasonal trade in equities is called theJanuary\\neffect. There are actually many versions of this trade. One ver-\\nsion states that small-cap stocks that had the worst returns in the\\nprevious calendar year will have higher returns in January than\\nsmall-cap stocks that had the best returns (Singal, 2006). The ra-\\ntionale for this is that investors like to sell their losers in Decem-\\nber to beneﬁt from tax losses, which creates additional downward'),\n",

As usual, one way to\\nalleviate this problem is to try somewhat different entry and exit\\ndates to see if the proﬁtability holds up. In addition, one should\\nconsider only those trades where the seasonality makes some eco-\\nnomic sense. The gasoline and natural gas trades amply satisfy these\\ncriteria.\\nHIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nSTRATEGIES\\nIn general, if a high Sharpe ratio is the goal of your trading strategy\\n(as it should be, given what I said in Chapter 6), then you should be\\ntrading at high frequencies, rather than holding stocks overnight.\\nWhat are high-frequency trading strategies, and why do they\\nhave superior Sharpe ratios? Many experts in high-frequency trading\\nwould not regard any strategy that holds positions for more than a\\nfew seconds as high frequency, but here I would take a more pedes-\\ntrian approach and include any strategy that does not hold a po-\\nsition overnight. Many of the early high-frequency strategies were\\napplied to the foreign exchange market, and then later on to the fu-\\ntures market, because of their abundance of liquidity. In the last six\\nor seven years, however, with the increasing liquidity in the equity\\nmarket, the availability of historical tick database for stocks, and\\nmushrooming computing power, this type of strategies has become\\nwidespread for stock trading as well.\\nThe reason why these strategies have Sharpe ratio is simple:\\nBased on the “law of large numbers,” the more bets you can place,\\nthe smaller the percent deviation from the mean return you will\\nexperience. With high-frequency trading, one can potentially place\\nhundreds if not thousands of bets all in one day. Therefore, pro-\\nvided the strategy is sound and generates positive mean return, you\\ncan expect the day-to-day deviation from this return to be minimal.\\nWith this high Sharpe ratio, one can increase the leverage to a much'),\n",

In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-\\nfrequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such\\nstrategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-\\nverting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral\\npair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-\\neral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in\\nthe market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.\\nUnlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals\\nwhere the market environment can experience upheavals during the\\nlifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist\\nday to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-\\nmore, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-\\nest sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for\\nhigh-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done\\nvery quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-\\ning and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The\\nworst that can happen as these strategies become more popular is a\\nslow death as a result of gradually diminishing returns. Sudden dras-\\ntic losses are not likely, nor are contagious losses across multiple\\naccounts.\\nThough successful high-frequency strategies have such numer-\\nous merits, it is not easy to backtest such strategies when the\\naverage holding period decreases to minutes or even seconds.\\nTransaction costs are of paramount importance in testing such\\nstrategies. Without incorporating transactions, the simplest strate-\\ngies may seem to work at high frequencies. As a consequence, just\\nhaving high-frequency data with last prices is not sufﬁcient—data\\nwith bid, ask, and last quotes is needed to ﬁnd out the proﬁtability\\nof executing on the bid versus the ask.

High-speed execution may account for a large part of the ac-\\ntual proﬁts or losses. Professional high-frequency trading ﬁrms have\\nbeen writing their strategies in C instead of other, more user-friendly\\nlanguages, and locating their servers next to the exchange or a ma-\\njor Internet backbone to reduce the microsecond delays. So even\\nthough the Sharpe ratio is appealing and the returns astronomical,\\ntruly high-frequency trading is not by any means easy for an inde-\\npendent trader to achieve in the beginning. But there is no reason\\nnot to work toward this goal gradually as expertise and resources\\naccrue.\\nIS IT BETTER TO HAVE\\nA HIGH-LEVERAGE VERSUS\\nAH I G H - B E T AP O R T F O L I O ?\\nIn Chapter 6, I discussed the optimal leverage to apply to a port-\\nfolio based on the Kelly formula. In the section on factor models\\nearlier in this chapter, I discussed the Fama-French Three-Factor\\nmodel, which suggests that return of a portfolio (or a stock) is\\nproportional to its beta (if we hold the market capitalization and\\nbook value of its stocks ﬁxed). In other words, you can increase\\nreturn on a portfolio by either increasing its leverage or increas-\\ning its beta (by selecting high-beta stocks.) Both ways seem com-\\nmonsensical. In fact, it is clear that given a low-beta portfolio and\\na high-beta portfolio, it is easy to apply a higher leverage on the\\nlow-beta portfolio so as to increase its beta to match that of the\\nhigh-beta portfolio. And assuming that the stocks of two portfo-\\nlios have the same average market capitalizations and book val-\\nues, the average returns of the two will also be the same (ignor-\\ning speciﬁc returns, which will decrease in importance as long as\\nwe increase the number stocks in the portfolios), according to the\\nFama-French model. So should we be indifferent to which portfolio\\nto own?\\nThe answer is no. Recall in Chapter 6 that the long-term com-\\npounded growth rate of a portfolio, if we use the Kelly leverage,'),\n",

So if the two hypothetical portfolios have the same average\\nreturn, then we would prefer the one that has the smaller risk or\\nstandard deviation. Empirical studies have found that a portfolio\\nthat consists of low-beta stocks generally has lower risk and thus\\na higher Sharpe ratio.\\nFor example, in a paper titled “Risk Parity Portfolios” (not pub-\\nlicly distributed), Dr. Edward Qian at PanAgora Asset Management\\nargued that a typical 60–40 asset allocation between stocks and\\nbonds is not optimal because it is overweighted with risky assets\\n(stocks in this case). Instead, to achieve a higher Sharpe ratio while\\nmaintaining the same risk level as the 60–40 portfolio, Dr. Qian rec-\\nommended a 23–77 allocation while leveraging the entire portfolio\\nby 1.8.\\nSomehow, the market is chronically underpricing high-beta\\nstocks. Hence, given a choice between a portfolio of high-beta\\nstocks and a portfolio of low-beta stocks, we should prefer the low-\\nbeta one, which we can then leverage up to achieve the maximum\\ncompounded growth rate.\\nThere is one usual caveat, however. All this is based on the Gaus-\\nsian assumption of return distributions. (See discussions in Chapter\\n6 on this issue.) Since the actual returns distributions have fat tails,\\none should be quite wary of using too much leverage on normally\\nlow-beta stocks.\\nSUMMARY\\nThis book has been largely about a particular type of quantitative\\ntrading called statistical arbitrage in the investment industry. De-\\nspite this fancy name, statistical arbitrage is actually far simpler\\nthan trading derivatives (e.g., options) or ﬁxed-income instruments,\\nboth conceptually and mathematically. I have described a large part\\nof the statistical arbitrageur’s standard arsenal: mean reversion and\\nmomentum, regime switching, stationarity and cointegration, arbi-\\ntrage pricing theory or factor model, seasonal trading models, and,\\nﬁnally, high-frequency trading.'),\n",

I ﬁgured that if I could not trade proﬁtably when I was free of\\nall institutional constraints and politics, then either trading is a hoax\\nor I am just not cut out to be a trader. Either way, I promised myself\\nthat in such an event I would quit trading forever. Fortunately, I sur-\\nvived. Along the way, I also found the key to that central mystery to\\nwhich I alluded earlier.\\nThe key, it turns out, iscapacity, a concept I introduced at the\\nend of Chapter 2. (To recap: Capacity is the amount of equity a strat-\\negy can generate good returns on.) It is far, far easier to generate\\na high Sharpe ratio trading a $100,000 account than a $100 million\\naccount. There are many simple and proﬁtable strategies that can\\nwork at the low capacity end that would be totally unsuitable to\\nhedge funds. This is the niche for independent traders like us.\\nLet me elaborate on this capacity issue. Most proﬁtable strate-\\ngies that have low capacities are acting as market makers: provid-\\ning short-term liquidity when it is needed and taking quick proﬁts\\nwhen the liquidity need disappears. If, however, you have billions\\nof dollars to manage, you now become the party in need of liquid-\\nity, and you have to pay for it. To minimize the cost of this liquidity\\ndemand, you necessarily have to hold your positions over long pe-\\nriods of time. When you hold for long periods, your portfolio will\\nbe subject to macroeconomic changes (i.e., regime shifts) that can\\ncause great damage to your portfolio. Though you may still be prof-\\nitable in the long run if your models are sound, you cannot avoid the\\noccasional sharp drawdowns that attract newspaper headlines.\\nOther disadvantages beset large-capacity strategies favored by\\nlarge institutions. The intense competition among hedge funds\\nmeans the strategies become less proﬁtable. The lowered returns\\nin turn pressure the fund manager to overleverage. To beat out the\\ncompetition, traders need to resort to more and more complicated\\nmodels, which in turn invite data-snooping bias. But despite the in-\\ncreasing complexity of the models, the fundamental market inefﬁ-\\nciency that they are trying to exploit may remain the same, and thus\\ntheir portfolios may still end up holding very similar positions. We\\ndiscussed this phenomenon in Chapter 6. When market environment'),\n",

For example, as a trader in a\\nquantitative fund, you may be prohibited from trading a long-only\\nstrategy, but long-only strategies are often easier to ﬁnd, simpler,\\nmore proﬁtable, and if traded in small sizes, no more risky than\\nmarket-neutral strategies. Or you may be prohibited from trading\\nfutures. You may be required to be not only market neutral but\\nalso sector neutral. You may be asked to ﬁnd a momentum strat-\\negy when you know that a mean-reverting strategy would work.\\nAnd on and on. Many of these constraints are imposed for risk\\nmanagement reasons, but many others may be just whims, quirks,\\nand prejudices of the management. As every student of mathe-\\nmatical optimization knows, any constraint imposed on an opti-\\nmization problem decreases the optimal objective value. Similarly,\\nevery institutional constraint imposed on a trading strategy tends to\\ndecrease its returns, if not its Sharpe ratio as well. Finally, some\\nsenior managers who oversee frontline portfolio managers of quan-\\ntitative funds are actually not well versed in quantitative techniques,\\nand they tend to make decisions based on anything but quantitative\\ntheories.\\nWhen your strategy shows initial proﬁts, these managers may\\nimpose enormous pressure for you to scale up quickly, and when\\nyour strategy starts to lose, they may force you to liquidate the port-\\nfolios and abandon the strategy immediately. None of these inter-\\nferences in the quantitative investment process is mathematically\\noptimal.\\nBesides, such managers often have a mercurial temper, which\\nseldom mixes well with quantitative investment management. When\\nloss of money occurs, rationality is often the ﬁrst victim.\\nAs an independent trader, you are free from such constraints\\nand interferences, and as long as you are emotionally capable to\\nadhere to the discipline of quantitative trading, your trading envi-\\nronment may actually be closer to the optimal than that of a large\\nfund.'),\n",

Where do you go from here?\\nHow do yougrow?\\nActually, I discussed growth in Chapter 6, but in a limited sense.\\nUsing the Kelly formula, you can indeed achieve exponential growth\\nof your equity, but only up to the total capacity of your strategies. Af-\\nter that, the source of growth has to come from increasing the num-\\nber of strategies. You can, for example, look for strategies that trade\\nat higher frequencies than the ones you currently have. To do that,\\nyou have to invest and upgrade your technological infrastructure,\\nand purchase expensive high-frequency historical data. Or, con-\\nversely, you can look for strategies that hold longer periods. Despite\\ntheir typically lower Sharpe ratios, they do enormously improve\\nyour capacity. For many of these strategies, you probably have to\\ninvest in expensive historical fundamental data for your backtest.\\nIf you are an equity trader, you can branch out into futures or\\ncurrencies, which typically have higher capacities than equity mod-\\nels. If you run out of ideas or lack expertise in a new market that you\\nwant to enter, you can form collaborations with other like-minded\\ntraders, or you can hire consultants to help with the research. If you\\nare running too many strategies to manage manually on your own,\\nyou can push your automation further so that there is no need for\\nyou to manually intervene in the daily trading unless exceptions or\\nproblems occur. Of course, you can also hire a trader to monitor all\\nthese strategies for you.\\nThese investments in data, infrastructure, and personnel are all\\npart of reinvesting some of your earnings to further the growth of\\nyour trading business, not unlike growing any other type of busi-\\nness.

Once you have\\nautomated everything and your equity is growing exponentially, can\\nyou just sit back, relax, and enjoy your wealth? Unfortunately, ex-\\nperience tells us that strategies do lose their potency over time as\\nmore traders catch on to them. It takes ongoing research to supply\\nyou with new strategies.\\nThere are always upheavals and major regime changes that may\\noccur once every decade but will nevertheless cause sudden deaths\\nto certain strategies. As with any commercial endeavor, a period of\\nrapid growth will inevitably be followed by the steady if unspectac-\\nular returns of a mature business.

(Many of\\nthe ﬁgures and charts in this book are created using MATLAB.) Fi-\\nnally, MATLAB codes can be compiled into C or C++ executables\\nthat can run on computers without the MATLAB platform installed.\\nIn fact, there is third-party software that can convert MATLAB code\\ninto C source codes, too.\\nThe basic syntax of MATLAB is very similar to Visual Basic or C.\\nFor example, we can initialize the elements of an array x like this:\\nx(1)=0.1;\\nx(2)=0.3;\\n% 3 elements of an array initialized.\\n% This is by default a row-vector\\nx(3)=0.2;\\nNote that we don’t need to ﬁrst “declare” this array, nor do we\\nneed to tell MATLAB its expected size beforehand. If you leave out\\nthe “;” sign, MATLAB will print out the result of the content of the\\nvariable being assigned a value. Any comments can be written after\\nthe “%” sign. If you wish, you can initialize a large number of ele-\\nments en masse to a common value:\\n% assigning the value 0.8 to all elements of a 3-vector y.\\nThis is a row-vector.y=0.8*ones(1, 3)\\nNow if you want to do a vector addition of the two vectors, you\\ncan do it the old-fashioned way (just as you would in C), that is,\\nusing a loop:\\nfor i=1:3\\nz(i)=x(i)+y(i) % z is [0.9 1.1 1]\\nend\\nBut the power of MATLAB is that it can handle many array oper-\\nations in parallel very succinctly, without using loops.

The answer is “yes,” \\nand in Quantitative Trading, author Dr. Ernest Chan, \\na respected independent trader and consultant, will \\nshow you how.\\nWhether you’re an independent “retail” trader looking \\nto start your own quantitative trading business or an \\nindividual who aspires to work as a quantitative \\ntrader at a major ﬁ nancial institution, this practical \\nguide contains the information you need to succeed.\\nOrganized around the steps you should take to start \\ntrading quantitatively, this book skillfully addresses \\nhow to:\\n\\x7f Find a viable trading strategy that you’re both comfortable \\nw\\nith and confident in\\n\\x7f Backtest your strategy—with MATLAB ®, Excel, and other \\nplatforms—to ensure good historical performance\\n\\x7f Build and implement an automated trading system to \\ne\\nxecute your strategy\\n\\x7f Scale up or wind down your strategies depending on their \\nr\\neal-world profitability\\n\\x7f Manage the money and risks involved in holding positions \\ngenerated\\n by your strategy\\n\\x7f Incorporate advanced concepts that most professionals use \\ni\\nnto your everyday trading activities\\n\\x7f And much more\\nWh\\nile Dr. Chan takes the time to outline the essential \\naspects of turning quantitative trading strategies \\ninto proﬁ ts, he doesn’t get into overly theoretical \\nor sophisticated theories. Instead, he highlights the \\nsimple tools and techniques you can use to gain a \\nmuch-needed edge over today’s institutional traders.\\nAnd for those who want to keep up with the \\nlatest news, ideas, and trends in quantitative \\ntrading, you’re welcome to visit Dr. Chan’s blog, \\nepchan.blogspot.com, as well as his premium \\ncontent Web site, epchan.com/subscriptions, \\nwhich you’ll have free access to with purchase of \\nthis book.\\nAs an independent trader, you’re free from the con-\\nstraints found in today’s institutional environment—\\nand as long as you adhere to the discipline of \\nquantitative trading, you can achieve signiﬁ cant \\nr e t u r n s .

Ernest Chan does all \\ntraders, current and prospective, a real service by succinctly outlining the tremendous beneﬁ ts, but also \\nsome of the pitfalls, in utilizing many of the recently implemented quantitative trading techniques.”\\n— PETER BORISH, Chairman and CEO, Computer Trading Corporation\\n“Dr. Ernest Chan provides an optimal framework for strategy development, back-testing, risk management, \\npr\\nogramming knowledge, and real-time system implementation to develop and run an algorithmic trading \\nbusiness step by step in Quantitative Trading.”\\n— YASER ANWAR, trader\\n“Quantitative systematic trading is a challenging ﬁ  e l d  t h a t  h a s  a l w a y s  b e e n  s h r o u d e d  i n  m y s t e r y ,  \\nseemingly too difﬁ cult to master by all but an elite few. In this honest and practical guide, Dr. Chan \\nhighlights the essential cornerstones of a successful automated trading operation and shares lessons he \\nlearned the hard way while offering clear direction to steer readers away from common traps that both \\nindividual and institutional traders often succumb to.”\\n— ROSARIO M. INGARGIOLA, CTO, Alphacet, Inc.\\n“This book provides valuable insight into how private investors can establish a solid structure for success \\ni\\nn algorithmic trading. Ernie’s extensive hands-on experience in building trading systems is invaluable for \\naspiring traders who wish to take their knowledge to the next level.”\\n— RAMON CUMMINS, private investor\\n“Out of the many books and articles on quantitative trading that I’ve read over the years, very few have \\nb\\neen of much use at all. In most instances, the authors have no real knowledge of the subject matter, or do \\nhave something important to say but are unwilling to do so because of fears of having trade secrets stolen. \\nErnie subscribes to a different credo: Share meaningful information and have meaningful interactions \\nwith the quantitative community at large. Ernie successfully distills a large amount of detailed and difﬁ cult \\nsubject matter down to a very clear and comprehensive resource for novice and pro alike.”\\n— STEVE HALPERN, founder, HCC Capital, LLC\\nWiley Trading\\nERNEST P.

This can be shown to be\\ntrue on many fronts.\\nMany legendary quantitative hedge fund managers such as Dr.\\nEdward Thorp of the former Princeton-Newport Partners (Pound-\\nstone, 2005) and Dr. Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies Corp.\\n(Lux, 2000) started their careers trading their own money. They did\\nnot begin as portfolio managers for investment banks and hedge\\nfunds before starting their own fund management business. Of\\ncourse, there are also plenty of counterexamples, but clearly this\\nis a possible route to riches as well as intellectual accomplishment,\\nand for someone with an entrepreneurial bent, a preferred route.\\nEven if your goal is to become an institutional trader, it is still\\nworthwhile to start your own trading business as a ﬁrst step. Physi-\\ncists and mathematicians are now swarming Wall Street. Few peo-\\nple on the Street are impressed by a mere PhD from a prestigious\\nuniversity anymore. What is the surest way to get through the door\\nof the top banks and funds? To show that you have a systematic\\nway to proﬁts—in other words, a track record. Quite apart from\\nserving as a stepping stone to a lucrative career in big institutions,\\nhaving a proﬁtable track record as an independent trader is an in-\\nvaluable experience in itself. The experience forces you to focus on\\nsimple but proﬁtable strategies, and not get sidetracked by overly\\ntheoretical or sophisticated theories. It also forces you to focus\\non the nitty-gritty of quantitative trading that you won’t learn from\\nmost books: things such as how to build an order entry system that\\ndoesn’t cost $10,000 of programming resource. Most importantly, it\\nforces you to focus on risk management—after all, your own per-\\nsonal bankruptcy is a possibility here. Finally, having been an insti-\\ntutional as well as a retail quantitative trader and strategist at differ-\\nent times, I only wish that I had read a similar book before I started\\nmy career at a bank—I would have achieved proﬁtability many\\nyears sooner.\\nGiven these preambles, I won’t make any further apologies in\\nthe rest of the book in focusing on the entrepreneurial, indepen-\\ndent traders and how they can build a quantitative trading business\\non their own, while hoping that many of the lessons would be useful\\non their way to institutional money management as well.'),\n",

Yes, you do need to possess some basic knowledge\\nof statistics, such as how to calculate averages, standard deviations,\\nor how to ﬁt a straight line through a set of data points. Yes, you\\nalso need to have some basic familiarity with Excel. But what you\\ndon’t need is any advanced knowledge of stochastic calculus, neural\\nnetworks, or other impressive-sounding techniques.\\nThough it is true that you can make millions with nothing more\\nthan Excel, it is also true that there is another tool that, if you are\\nproﬁcient at it, will enable you to backtest trading strategies much\\nmore efﬁciently, and may also allow you to retrieve and process\\ndata much more easily than you otherwise can. This tool is called\\nMATLAB®, and it is a mathematical platform that many institutional\\nquantitative strategists and portfolio managers use. Therefore, I will\\ndemonstrate how to backtest the majority of strategies using MAT-\\nLAB. In fact, I have included a brief tutorial in the appendix on how\\nto do some basic programming in MATLAB. For many retail traders,\\nMATLAB is too expensive to purchase, but there are cheaper alter-\\nnatives, which I will mention in Chapter 3 on backtesting. Further-\\nmore, many university students can either purchase a cheaper stu-\\ndent MATLAB license or they already have free access to it through\\ntheir schools.\\nWHAT WILL YOU FIND IN THIS BOOK?\\nThis book is deﬁnitely not designed as an encyclopedia of quantita-\\ntive trading techniques or terminologies. It will not even be about\\nspeciﬁc proﬁtable strategies (although you can reﬁne the few ex-\\nample strategies embedded here to make them quite proﬁtable.) In-\\nstead, this is a book that teaches you how to ﬁnd a proﬁtable strategy\\nyourself. It teaches you the characteristics of a good strategy, how\\nto reﬁne and backtest a strategy to ensure that it has good historical\\nperformance, and, more importantly, to ensure that it will remain'),\n",

While I discuss sources of historical\\ndata on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on\\nbacktesting, I did not include options because those are not in my\\narea of expertise.\\nThe book is organized roughly in the order of the steps that\\ntraders need to undertake to set up their quantitative trading busi-\\nness. These steps begin at ﬁnding a viable trading strategy (Chap-\\nter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has\\ngood historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business\\nand technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated\\ntrading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing\\nthe money and risks involved in holding positions generated by this\\nstrategy (Chapter 6). I will then describe in Chapter 7 a number of\\nimportant advanced concepts with which most professional quan-\\ntitative traders are familiar, and ﬁnally conclude in Chapter 8 with\\nreﬂections on how independent traders can ﬁnd their niche and how\\nthey can grow their business. I have also included an appendix that\\ncontains a tutorial on using MATLAB.\\nYou’ll see two different types of boxed material in this book:\\nr Sidebars containing an elaboration or illustration of a concept, and\\nr Examples, accompanied by MATLAB or Excel code.'),\n",

But even for readers who\\nlearned about this kind of trading from the mainstream media\\nbefore, it is worth clearing up some common misconceptions.\\nQuantitative trading, also known as algorithmic trading, is the\\ntrading of securities based strictly on the buy/sell decisions of com-\\nputer algorithms. The computer algorithms are designed and per-\\nhaps programmed by the traders themselves, based on the histor-\\nical performance of the encoded strategy tested against historical\\nﬁnancial data.\\nIs quantitative trading just a fancy name for technical analysis,\\nthen? Granted, a strategy based on technical analysis can be part of\\na quantitative trading system if it can be fully encoded as computer\\nprograms. However, not all technical analysis can be regarded as\\nquantitative trading. For example, certain chartist techniques such\\nas “look for the formation of a head and shoulders pattern” might\\nnot be included in a quantitative trader’s arsenal because they are\\nquite subjective and may not be quantiﬁable.\\nYet quantitative trading includes more than just technical anal-\\nysis. Many quantitative trading systems incorporate fundamental\\ndata in their inputs: numbers such as revenue, cash ﬂow, debt-to-\\nequity ratio, and others.

When it comes to judging the current ﬁnancial per-\\nformance of a company compared to its peers or compared to its\\nhistorical performance, the computer is often just as good as hu-\\nman ﬁnancial analysts—and the computer can watch thousands of\\nsuch companies all at once. Some advanced quantitative systems\\ncan even incorporate news events as inputs: Nowadays, it is pos-\\nsible to use a computer to parse and understand the news report.\\n(After all, I used to be a researcher in this very ﬁeld at IBM, work-\\ning on computer systems that can understand approximately what a\\ndocument is about.)\\nSo you get the picture: As long as you can convert information\\ninto bits and bytes that the computer can understand, it can be re-\\ngarded as part of quantitative trading.\\nWHO CAN BECOME A\\nQUANTITATIVE TRADER?\\nIt is true that most institutional quantitative traders received their\\nadvanced degrees as physicists, mathematicians, engineers, or com-\\nputer scientists. This kind of training in the hard sciences is often\\nnecessary when you want to analyze or trade complex derivative\\ninstruments. But those instruments are not the focus in this book.\\nThere is no law stating that one can become wealthy only by work-\\ning with complicated ﬁnancial instruments. (In fact, one can become\\nquite poor trading complex mortgage-backed securities, as the ﬁnan-\\ncial crisis of 2007–08 and the demise of Bear Stearns have shown.)\\nThe kind of quantitative trading I focus on is calledstatistical ar-\\nbitrage trading.Statistical arbitrage deals with the simplest ﬁnan-\\ncial instruments: stocks, futures, and sometimes currencies.

Hundreds of millions of dollars of trades later, what\\nwas the result? Losses, more losses, and losses as far as the eye can\\nsee, for my employers and their investors. Finally, I quit the ﬁnan-\\ncial industry in frustration, set up a spare bedroom in my home as\\nmy trading ofﬁce, and started to trade the simplest but still quan-\\ntitative strategies I know. These are strategies that any smart high\\nschool student can easily research and execute. For the ﬁrst time\\nin my life, my trading strategies became proﬁtable (one of which is\\ndescribed in Example 3.6), and has been the case ever since. The\\nlesson I learned?

As far as I know, most of them\\nare doing quite well on their own, while enjoying the enormous free-\\ndom that independence brings.\\nBesides having gained some knowledge of ﬁnance through their\\nformer jobs, the fact that these traders have saved up a nest egg\\nfor their independent venture is obviously important too. When one\\nplunges into independent trading, fear of losses and of being iso-\\nlated from the rest of the world is natural, and so it helps to have\\nboth a prior appreciation of risks and some savings to lean on. It is\\nimportant not to have a need for immediate proﬁts to sustain your\\ndaily living, as strategies have intrinsic rates of returns that cannot\\nbe hurried (see Chapter 6).\\nInstead of fear, some of you are planning to trade because of\\nthe love of thrill and danger, or an incredible self-conﬁdence that\\ninstant wealth is imminent. This is also a dangerous emotion to bring\\nto independent quantitative trading. As I hope to persuade you in\\nthis chapter and in the rest of the book, instant wealth is not the\\nobjective of quantitative trading.\\nThe ideal independent quantitative trader is therefore someone\\nwho has some prior experience with ﬁnance or computer program-\\nming, who has enough savings to withstand the inevitable losses and\\nperiods without income, and whose emotion has found the right bal-\\nance between fear and greed.\\nTHE BUSINESS CASE FOR\\nQUANTITATIVE TRADING\\nA lot of us are in the business of quantitative trading because it is\\nexciting, intellectually stimulating, ﬁnancially rewarding, or perhaps\\nit is the only thing we are good at doing. But for others who may have\\nalternative skills and opportunities, it is worth pondering whether\\nquantitative trading is the best business for you.\\nDespite all the talk about untold hedge fund riches and dollars\\nthat are measured in units of billions, in many ways starting a\\nquantitative trading business is very similar to starting any small\\nbusiness.

Here are some of the most\\nimportant.\\nScalability\\nCompared to most small businesses (other than certain dot-coms),\\nquantitative trading is very scalable (up to a point). It is easy to ﬁnd\\nyourselves trading millions of dollars in the comfort of your own\\nhome, as long as your strategy is consistently proﬁtable. This is be-\\ncause scaling up often just means changing a number in your pro-\\ngram. This number is calledleverage. You do not need to negotiate\\nwith a banker or a venture capitalist to borrow more capital for your\\nbusiness. The brokerages stand ready and willing to do that. If you\\nare a member of a proprietary trading ﬁrm (more on this later in\\nChapter 4 on setting up a business), you may even be able to obtain\\na leverage far exceeding that allowed by Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (SEC) Regulation T. It is not unheard of for a propri-\\netary trading ﬁrm to let you trade a portfolio worth $2 million in-\\ntraday even if you have only $50,000 equity in your account (a×40\\nleverage). At the same time, quantitative trading is deﬁnitely not a\\nget-rich-quick scheme. You should hope to have steadily increasing\\nproﬁts, but most likely it won’t be 200 percent a year, unlike starting\\na dot-com or a software ﬁrm. In fact, as I will explain in Chapter 6\\non money and risk management, it is dangerous to overleverage in\\npursuit of overnight riches.\\nDemand on Time\\nRunning most small businesses takes a lot of your time, at least\\ninitially. Quantitative trading takes relatively little of your time. By\\nits very nature, quantitative trading is a highly automated business.\\nSometimes, the more you manually interfere with the system and\\noverride its decision, the worse it will perform.

The rest of the time,\\nthey just sit at home and occasionally remotely monitor their ofﬁce\\ncomputers, which are trading for them.\\nI consider myself to be in the middle of the pack in terms of au-\\ntomation.

I would also update my spreadsheet\\nto record the previous day’s proﬁt and loss (P&L) of the different\\nstrategies I run based on the brokerages’ statements. All of this takes\\nabout two hours.\\nAfter that, I spend another half hour near the market close to di-\\nrect the programs to exit various positions, manually checking that\\nthose exit orders are correctly transmitted, and closing down vari-\\nous automated programs properly.\\nIn between market open and close, everything is supposed to be\\non autopilot. Alas, the spirit is willing but the ﬂesh is weak: I often\\ncannot resist the urge to take a look (sometimes many looks) at\\nthe intraday P&L of the various strategies on my trading screens. In\\nextreme situations, I might even be transﬁxed by the huge swings\\nin P&L and be tempted to intervene by manually exiting positions.\\nFortunately, I have learned to better resist the temptation as time\\ngoes on.\\nThe urge to intervene manually is also strong when I have too\\nmuch time on my hands. Hence, instead of just staring at your trad-\\ning screen, it is actually important to engage yourself in some other,\\nmore healthful and enjoyable activities, such as going to the gym\\nduring the trading day.\\nWhen I said quantitative trading takes little of your time, I am\\nreferring to the operational side of the business.

How do you recognize a good versus a bad strat-\\negy even before devoting any time to backtesting them? How do you\\nrigorously backtest them? If the backtest performance is good, what\\nsteps do you need to take to implement the strategy, in terms of both\\nthe business structure and the technological infrastructure? If the\\nstrategy is proﬁtable in initial real-life trading, how does one scale\\nup the capital to make it into a growing income stream while manag-\\ning the inevitable (but, hopefully, only occasional) losses that come\\nwith trading? These nuts and bolts of quantitative trading will be\\ntackled in Chapters 2 through 6.\\nThough the list of processes to go through in order to get to the\\nﬁnal destination of sustained and growing proﬁtability may seem\\nlong and daunting, in reality it may be faster and easier than many\\nother businesses. When I ﬁrst started as an independent trader, it\\ntook me only three months to ﬁnd and backtest my ﬁrst new strat-\\negy, set up a new brokerage account with $100,000 capital, imple-\\nment the execution system, and start trading the strategy. The strat-\\negy immediately became proﬁtable in the ﬁrst month. Back in the\\ndot-com era, I started an Internet software ﬁrm. It took about 3 times\\nmore investment, 5 times more human-power, and 24 times longer\\nto ﬁnd out that the business model didn’t work, whereupon all in-\\nvestors including myself lost 100 percent of their investments.

However, the trick is that you\\ncan often modify the basic strategy and make it proﬁtable. (Many\\nof these caveats as well as a few common variations on a basic\\nstrategy will be examined in detail in Chapter 3.)\\nFor example, someone once suggested a strategy to me that was\\ndescribed in Wealth-Lab (see Table 2.1), where it was claimed that it\\nhad a high Sharpe ratio. When I backtested the strategy, it turned out\\nnot to work as well as advertised. I then tried a few simple modiﬁca-\\ntions, such as decreasing the holding period and entering and exiting\\nat different times than suggested, and was able to turn this strategy\\ninto one of my main proﬁt centers.

Then, when I\\nﬁrst became independent, my level of automation was still relatively\\nlow, so I considered only strategies that require entering orders once\\nbefore the market opens and once before the close. Later on, I added\\na program that can automatically scan real-time market data and\\ntransmit orders to my brokerage account throughout the trading day\\nwhen certain conditions are met. So trading remains a “part-time”\\npursuit for me, which is partly why I want to trade quantitatively in\\nthe ﬁrst place.\\nYour Programming Skills\\nAre you good at programming? If you know some programming\\nlanguages such as Visual Basic or even Java, C#, or C++, you can\\nexplore high-frequency strategies, and you can also trade a large\\nnumber of securities.

In general, I would not recommend\\nquantitative trading for an account with less than $50,000 capi-\\ntal. Let’s say the dividing line between a high- versus low-capital\\naccount is $100,000. Capital availability affects many choices; the\\nﬁrst is whether you should open a retail brokerage account or a\\nproprietary trading account (more on this in Chapter 4 on setting\\nup your business).

Finally, capital (or leverage) availability de-\\ntermines whether you should focus on directional trades (long or\\nshort only) or dollar-neutral trades (hedged or pair trades). A dollar-\\nneutral portfolio (meaning the market value of the long positions\\nequals the market value of the short positions) or market-neutral\\nportfolio (meaning thebeta of the portfolio with respect to a mar-\\nket index is close to zero, wherebeta measures the ratio between\\nthe expected returns of the portfolio and the expected returns of\\nthe market index) require twice the capital or leverage of a long- or\\nshort-only portfolio.

It affects how much you can spend on various infrastruc-\\nture, data, and software. For example, if you have low trading capi-\\ntal, your online brokerage will not be likely to supply you with real-\\ntime market data for too many stocks, so you can’t really have a\\nstrategy that requires real-time market data over a large universe of\\nstocks. (You can, of course, subscribe to a third-party market data\\nvendor, but then the extra cost may not be justiﬁable if your trad-\\ning capital is low.) Similarly, clean historical stock data with high\\nfrequency costs more than historical daily stock data, so a high-\\nfrequency stock-trading strategy may not be feasible with small cap-\\nital expenditure. For historical stock data, there is another quality\\nthat may be even more important than their frequencies: whether\\nthe data are free of survivorship bias. I will deﬁne survivorship bias\\nin the following section.

Though a strategy may have the same average\\nreturn as the benchmark, perhaps it delivered positive returns every\\nmonth while the benchmark occasionally suffered some very bad\\nmonths. In this case, we would still deem the strategy superior.

For a strategy that\\nachieves proﬁtability almost every month, its (annualized) Sharpe\\nratio is typically greater than 2. For a strategy that is proﬁtable al-\\nmost every day, its Sharpe ratio is usually greater than 3. I will show\\nyou how to calculate Sharpe ratios for various strategies in Exam-\\nples 3.4, 3.6, and 3.7 in the next chapter.\\nHow Deep and Long Is the Drawdown?\\nA strategy suffers a drawdown whenever it has lost money recently.\\nA drawdown at a given timet is deﬁned as the difference between\\nthe current equity value (assuming no redemption or cash infusion)\\nof the portfolio and the global maximum of the equity curve occur-\\nring on or before timet. The maximum drawdownis the difference\\nbetween the global maximum of the equity curve with the global\\nminimum of the curve after the occurrence of the global maximum\\n(time order matters here: The global minimum must occur later\\nthan the global maximum). The global maximum is called the “high\\nwatermark.” Themaximum drawdown duration is the longest it\\nhas taken for the equity curve to recover losses.\\nMore often, drawdowns are measured in percentage terms, with\\nthe denominator being the equity at the high watermark, and the nu-\\nmerator being the loss of equity since reaching the high watermark.\\nFigure 2.1 illustrates a typical drawdown, the maximum draw-\\ndown, and the maximum drawdown duration of an equity curve.\\nI will include a tutorial in Example 3.5 on how to compute these\\nquantities from a table of daily proﬁts and losses using either Excel\\nor MATLAB. One thing to keep in mind: The maximum drawdown\\nand the maximum drawdown duration do not typically overlap over\\nthe same period.\\nDeﬁned mathematically, drawdown seems abstract and remote.\\nHowever, in real life there is nothing more gut-wrenching and\\nemotionally disturbing to suffer than a drawdown if you’re a trader.\\n(This is as true for independent traders as for institutional ones.\\nWhen an institutional trading group is suffering a drawdown, every-\\nbody seems to feel that life has lost meaning and spend their days'),\n",

It is therefore something we would want to mini-\\nmize. You have to ask yourself, realistically, how deep and how long\\na drawdown will you be able to tolerate and not liquidate your port-\\nfolio and shut down your strategy? Would it be 20 percent and three\\nmonths, or 10 percent and one month? Comparing your tolerance\\nwith the numbers obtained from the backtest of a candidate strat-\\negy determines whether that strategy is for you.\\nEven if the author of the strategy you read about did not pub-\\nlish the precise numbers for drawdowns, you should still be able to\\nmake an estimate from a graph of its equity curve. For example, in\\nFigure 2.1, you can see that the longest drawdown goes from around\\nFebruary 2001 to around October 2002. So the maximum drawdown\\nduration is about 20 months. Also, at the beginning of the maximum\\ndrawdown, the equity was about $2.3× 104, and at the end, about\\n$0.5 × 104. So the maximum drawdown is about $1.8× 104.\\nHow Will Transaction Costs Affect the Strategy?\\nEvery time a strategy buys and sells a security, it incurs a trans-\\naction cost. The more frequent it trades, the larger the impact of\\ntransaction costs will be on the proﬁtability of the strategy. These\\ntransaction costs are not just due to commission fees charged by\\nthe broker. There will also be the cost of liquidity—when you buy\\nand sell securities at their market prices, you are paying the bid-ask\\nspread. If you buy and sell securities using limit orders, however,\\nyou avoid the liquidity costs but incur opportunity costs. This is be-\\ncause your limit orders may not be executed, and therefore you may\\nmiss out on the potential proﬁts of your trade. Also, when you buy\\nor sell a large chunk of securities, you will not be able to complete\\nthe transaction without impacting the prices at which this transac-\\ntion is done. (Sometimes just displaying a bid to buy a large number\\nof shares for a stock can move the prices higher without your having\\nbought a single share yet!) This effect on the market prices due to\\nyour own order is calledmarket impact,and it can contribute to a\\nlarge part of the total transaction cost when the security is not very\\nliquid.'),\n",

This delay can cause a “slippage,” the difference be-\\ntween the price that triggers the order and the execution price. Of\\ncourse, this slippage can be of either sign, but on average it will be\\na cost rather than a gain to the trader. (If you ﬁnd that it is a gain on\\naverage, you should change your program to deliberately delay the\\ntransmission of the order by a few seconds!)\\nTransaction costs vary widely for different kinds of securities.\\nYou can typically estimate it by taking half the average bid-ask\\nspread of a security and then adding the commission if your or-\\nder size is not much bigger than the average sizes of the best bid\\nand offer. If you are trading S&P 500 stocks, for example, the aver-\\nage transaction cost (excluding commissions, which depend on your\\nbrokerage) would be about 5 basis points (that is, ﬁve-hundredths of\\na percent). Note that I count a round-trip transaction of a buy and\\nthen a sell as two transactions—hence, a round trip will cost 10 ba-\\nsis points in this example. If you are trading ES, the E-mini S&P 500\\nfutures, the transaction cost will be about 1 basis point. Sometimes\\nthe authors whose strategies you read about will disclose that they\\nhave included transaction costs in their backtest performance, but\\nmore often they will not. If they haven’t, then you just to have to\\nassume that the results are before transactions, and apply your own\\njudgment to its validity.\\nAs an example of the impact of transaction costs on a strategy,\\nconsider this simple mean-reverting strategy on ES. It is based on\\nBollinger bands: that is, every time the price exceeds plus or minus\\n2 moving standard deviations of its moving average, short or buy, re-\\nspectively. Exit the position when the price reverts back to within 1\\nmoving standard deviation of the moving average. If you allow your-\\nself to enter and exit every ﬁve minutes, you will ﬁnd that the Sharpe\\nratio is about 3 without transaction costs—very excellent indeed!\\nUnfortunately, the Sharpe ratio is reduced to –3 if we subtract 1 ba-\\nsis point as transaction costs, making it a very unproﬁtable strategy.\\nFor another example of the impact of transaction costs, see\\nExample 3.7.'),\n",

(The same term can be applied to mutual fund or hedge\\nfund databases that do not include funds that went out of business.)\\nBacktesting a strategy using data with survivorship bias can be dan-\\ngerous because it may inﬂate the historical performance of the strat-\\negy. This is especially true if the strategy has a “value” bent; that is,\\nit tends to buy stocks that are cheap. Some stocks were cheap be-\\ncause the companies were going bankrupt shortly. So if your strat-\\negy includes only those cases when the stocks were very cheap\\nbut eventually survived (and maybe prospered) and neglects those\\ncases where the stocks ﬁnally did get delisted, the backtest perfor-\\nmance will, of course, be much better than what a trader would ac-\\ntually have suffered at that time.\\nSo when you read about a “buy on the cheap” strategy that has\\ngreat performance, ask the author of that strategy whether it was\\ntested on survivorship bias–free (sometimes called “point-in-time”)\\ndata. If not, be skeptical of its results. (A toy strategy that illustrates\\nthis can be found in Example 3.3.)\\nHow Did the Performance of the Strategy\\nChange over the Years?\\nMost strategies performed much better 10 years ago than now, at\\nleast in a backtest. There weren’t as many hedge funds running\\nquantitative strategies then. Also, bid-ask spreads were much wider\\nthen: So if you assumed the transaction cost today was applicable\\nthroughout the backtest, the earlier period would have unrealisti-\\ncally high returns.\\nSurvivorship bias in the data might also contribute to the good\\nperformance in the early period. The reason that survivorship bias\\nmainly inﬂates the performance of an earlier period is that the fur-\\nther back we go in our backtest, the more missing stocks we will'),\n",

Simple models are often the ones\\nthat will stand the test of time. (See the sidebar on my views on\\nartiﬁcial intelligence and stock picking.)\\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND STOCK\\nPICKING*\\nThere was an article in theNew York Timesa short while ago about a new hedge\\nfund launched by Mr. Ray Kurzweil, a pioneer in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence.\\n(Thanks to my fellow blogger, Yaser Anwar, who pointed it out to me.) According\\nto Kurzweil, the stock-picking decisions in this fund are supposed to be made\\nby machines that “... can observe billions of market transactions to see patterns\\nwe could never see” (quoted in Duhigg, 2006).\\nWhile I am certainly a believer in algorithmic trading, I have become a skep-\\ntic when it comes to trading based on “artiﬁcial intelligence.”\\nAt the risk of oversimpliﬁcation, we can characterize artiﬁcial intelligence\\n(AI) as trying to ﬁt past data points into a function with many, many param-\\neters. This is the case for some of the favorite tools of AI: neural networks,\\ndecision trees, and genetic algorithms. With many parameters, we can for sure\\ncapture small patterns that no human can see. But do these patterns persist?\\nOr are they random noises that will never replay again? Experts in AI assure\\nus that they have many safeguards against ﬁtting the function to transient\\nnoise. And indeed, such tools have been very eﬀective in consumer market-\\ning and credit card fraud detection. Apparently, the patterns of consumers and\\nthefts are quite consistent over time, allowing such AI algorithms to work even\\nwith a large number of parameters. However, from my experience, these safe-\\nguards work far less well in ﬁnancial markets prediction, and overﬁtting to\\nthe noise in historical data remains a rampant problem. As a matter of fact,\\nI have built ﬁnancial predictive models based on many of these AI algorithms in\\nthe past. Every time a carefully constructed model that seems to work marvels\\nin backtest came up, they inevitably performed miserably going forward. The\\nmain reason for this seems to be that the amount of statistically independent\\nﬁnancial data is far more limited compared to the billions of independent con-\\nsumer and credit transactions available. (You may think that there is a lot of tick-\\nby-tick ﬁnancial data to mine, but such data is serially correlated and far from\\nindependent.)'),\n",

Even if you found a strategy described in\\ncomplete detail with all the historical performance data available,\\nyou would still need to backtest it yourself. This exercise serves\\nseveral purposes. If nothing else, this replication of the research will\\nensure that you have understood the strategy completely and have\\nreproduced it exactly for implementation as a trading system. Just\\nas in any medical or scientiﬁc research, replicating others’ results\\nalso ensures that the original research did not commit any of the\\ncommon errors plaguing this process. But more than just perform-\\ning due diligence, doing the backtest yourself allows you to exper-\\niment with variations of the original strategy, thereby reﬁning and\\nimproving the strategy.\\nIn this chapter, I will describe the common platforms that can\\nbe used for backtesting, various sources of historical data useful for\\nbacktesting, a minimal set of standard performance measures that a\\nbacktest should provide, common pitfalls to avoid, and simple re-\\nﬁnements and improvements to strategies. A few fully developed\\nbacktesting examples will also be presented to illustrate the prin-\\nciples and techniques described.\\n31'),\n",

In\\nkeeping with the focus on start-ups in this book, I start with those\\nwith which I am familiar and that can be purchased economically\\nand are widely used.\\nExcel\\nThis is the most basic and most common tool for traders, whether\\nretail or institutional. You can enhance its power further if you can\\nwrite Visual Basic macros. The beauty of Excel is “What you see\\nis what you get” (or WYSIWYG in computing parlance). Data and\\nprogram are all in one place so that nothing is hidden. Also, a com-\\nmon backtesting pitfall called “look-ahead bias,” which will be ex-\\nplained later, is unlikely to occur in Excel (unless you use macros,\\nwhich renders it no longer WYSIWYG) because you can easily align\\nthe dates with the various data columns and signals on a spread-\\nsheet. Another advantage of Excel is that often backtesting and live\\ntrade generation can be done from the same spreadsheet, eliminat-\\ning any duplication of programming efforts. The major disadvantage\\nof Excel is that it can be used to backtest only fairly simple models.\\nBut, as I explained in the previous chapter, simple models are often\\nthe best!\\nMATLAB\\nMATLAB R⃝ (www.mathworks.com) is one of the most common\\nbacktesting platforms used by quantitative analysts and traders in\\nlarge institutions. It is ideal for testing strategies that involve a\\nlarge portfolio of stocks. (Imagine backtesting a strategy involving\\n1,500 symbols on Excel—it is possible, but quite painful.). It has nu-\\nmerous advanced statistical and mathematical modules built in, so\\ntraders do not have to reinvent the wheel if their trading algorithms\\ninvolve some sophisticated but common mathematical concepts.'),\n",

See Example 7.4.) There\\nis also a large number of third-party freeware available for down-\\nload from the Internet, many of them very useful for quantitative\\ntrading purposes (an example is the cointegration package used in\\nExample 7.2). Finally, MATLAB is very useful in retrieving web\\npages with ﬁnancial information and parsing it into a useful form\\n(so-called web scraping). Example 3.1 shows how this can be done.\\nDespite the seeming sophistication of the platform, it is actually\\nvery easy to learn (at least for basic usage) and it is very quick to\\nwrite a complete backtest program using this language. The main\\ndrawback of MATLAB is that it is relatively expensive: it costs over\\n$1,000 to acquire a license. However, there are several clones of\\nMATLAB on the market where you can write and use codes that\\nare very similar to MATLAB:\\nr O-Matrix (www.omatrix.com)\\nr Octave (www.gnu.org/software/octave)\\nr Scilab (www.scilab.org)\\nThese clones may cost only several hundred dollars, or may be\\nentirely free. Not surprisingly, the more expensive the clone is, the\\nmore compatible it is with programs written in MATLAB. (Of course,\\nif you intend to write all the programs yourself and not use any third\\nparty’s codes, compatibility is not an issue. But then you would be\\nforfeiting one of the main beneﬁts of using this language.) The other\\ndrawback of MATLAB is that it is very useful for backtesting but\\nclumsy to use as an execution platform. So, often, you will need\\nto build a separate execution system in another language once you\\nhave backtested your strategy. Despite these drawbacks, MATLAB\\nhas found widespread use within the quantitative trading commu-\\nnity. I will include MATLAB codes for all the backtesting examples\\nin this book as well as provide a quick survey of the MATLAB lan-\\nguage itself in the appendix.'),\n",

(If you adjust\\nby subtracting $dinstead, the historical daily changes in prices will\\nbe the same pre- and postadjustment, but not the daily returns.) If\\nthe historical data are not adjusted, you will ﬁnd a drop in price\\nat the ex-date’s market open from previous day’s close (apart from\\nnormal market ﬂuctuation), which may trigger an erroneous trading\\nsignal.\\nI recommend getting historical data that are already split and\\ndividend adjusted, because otherwise you would have to ﬁnd a\\nseparate historical database (such as earnings.com) of splits and\\ndividends and apply the adjustments yourself—a somewhat te-\\ndious and error-prone task, which I will describe in the following\\nexample.\\nExample 3.2: Adjusting for Splits and Dividends\\nHere we look at IGE, an ETF that has had both splits and dividends in its\\nhistory.

(This\\ncould be due to the fact that a very small order was transacted at the\\nhigh, or the execution could have occurred on a market to which\\nyour order was not routed.

This is due to the fact that\\nthe historical prices shown may be due to the primary exchange\\n(e.g., New York Stock Exchange [NYSE]), or it may be a composite\\nprice including all the regional exchanges. Depending on where your\\norder was routed, it may be ﬁlled at a different price from the his-\\ntorical opening or closing price shown in your dataset. Neverthe-\\nless, the discrepancies of the open and close prices usually have\\nless impact on backtest performance than the errors in the high\\nand low prices, since the latter almost always inﬂate your backtest\\nreturns.\\nAfter retrieving the data from a database, it is often advisable to\\ndo a quick error check.

Notice that I did not include average an-\\nnualized returns, the measure most commonly quoted by investors,\\nbecause if you use this measure, you have to tell people a number\\nof things about what denominator you use to calculate returns. For\\nexample, in a long-short strategy, did you use just one side of capital\\nor both sides in the denominator? Is the return a leveraged one (the\\ndenominator is based on account equity), or is it unleveraged (the\\ndenominator is based on market value of the portfolio)? If the equity\\nor market value changes daily, do you use a moving average as the\\ndenominator, or just the value at the end of each day or each month?\\nMost (but not all) of these problems associated with comparing re-\\nturns can be avoided by quoting Sharpe ratio and drawdown instead\\nas the standard performance measures.\\nI introduced the concepts of the Sharpe ratio, maximum draw-\\ndown, and maximum drawdown duration in Chapter 2. Here, I will\\njust note a number of subtleties associated with calculating the\\nSharpe ratio, and give some computational examples in both Excel\\nand MATLAB.\\nThere is one subtlety that often confounds even seasoned port-\\nfolio managers when they calculate Sharpe ratios: should we or\\nshouldn’t we subtract the risk-free rate from the returns of a dollar-\\nneutral portfolio?

Meanwhile, the mar-\\ngin balance you have to maintain earns a credit interest close to the\\nrisk-free raterF. So let’s say the strategy return (the portfolio return\\nminus the contribution from the credit interest) isR, and the risk-\\nfree rate isrF. Then the excess return used in calculating the Sharpe\\nratio isR + rF – rF = R. So, essentially, you can ignore the risk-free\\nrate in the whole calculation and just focus on the returns due to\\nyour stock positions.\\nSimilarly, if you have a long-only day-trading strategy that does\\nnot hold positions overnight, you again have no need to subtract the\\nrisk-free rate from the strategy return in order to obtain the excess\\nreturns, since you do not have ﬁnancing costs in this case, either. In\\ngeneral, you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy\\nreturns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs\\nﬁnancing cost.\\nTo further facilitate comparison across strategies, most traders\\nannualize the Sharpe ratio. Most people know how to annualize the\\naverage returns. For example, if you have been using monthly re-\\nturns, then the average annual return is just 12 times the average\\nmonthly return.\\nHowever, annualizing the standard deviation of returns is a bit\\ntrickier. Here, based on the assumption that the monthly returns are\\nserially uncorrelated (Sharpe, 1994), the annual standard deviation\\nof returns is\\n√\\n12 times the monthly standard deviation. Hence, over-\\nall, the annualized Sharpe ratio would be\\n√\\n12 times the monthly\\nSharpe ratio.\\nIn general, if you calculate your average and standard deviation\\nof returns based on a certain trading periodT, whether T is a month,\\na day, or an hour, and you want to annualize these quantities, you\\nhave to ﬁrst ﬁnd out how many such trading periods there are in a\\nyear (call itNT). Then\\nAnnualized Sharpe Ratio=\\n√\\nNT × Sharpe Ratio Based onT'),\n",

The ﬁrst step in this calculation is to calculate the “high\\nwatermark” at the close of each day, which is the maximum cumulative re-\\nturn of the strategy up to that time.

Name this column\\nHigh watermark.\\n5. In cell O3, type “=(1+N3)/(1+M3)-1”. This is the drawdown at that day’s\\nclose. Populate the entire column O with the drawdowns of the strategy.\\n6. In cell O1506, type “=MAX(O3:O1505)”. This is the maximum draw-\\ndown of the strategy. It should have a value of about 0.1053, that is, a\\nmaximum drawdown of 10.53 percent.\\n7. In cell P3, type “=IF(O3=0, 0, P2+1)”. This is the duration of the current\\ndrawdown. Populate the entire column R with the drawdown durations\\nof the strategy and erase the last cell of the column.\\n8. In cell P1506, type “=MAX(P3:P1505)”. This is the maximum drawdown\\nduration of the strategy.

I will describe two of the most common ones here,\\nwith tips on how to avoid them.\\nLook-Ahead Bias\\nThis error refers to the situation when you are using information\\nthat was available only at a timeahead of the instant the trade was\\nmade. For example, if your trade entry rule reads: “Buy when the\\nstock is within 1 percent of the day’s low,” you have introduced a\\nlook-ahead bias in your strategy, because you could not possibly\\nhave known what the day’s low was until the market closed that\\nday. Another example: Suppose a model involves a linear regression\\nﬁt of two price series. If you use the regression coefﬁcients obtained\\nfrom the entire data set to determine your daily trading signals, you\\nhave again introduced look-ahead bias.\\nHow do we avoid look-ahead bias? Uselagged historical data\\nfor calculating signals at every opportunity. Lagging a series of data\\nmeans that you calculate all the quantities like moving averages,\\nhighs and lows, or even volume, based on data up to the close of the\\nprevious trading period only. (Of course, you needn’t lag the data if\\nyour strategy enters only at the close of the period.)\\nLook-ahead bias is easier to avoid using Excel or other WYSI-\\nWYG programs than using MATLAB. This is because it is easy to\\nalign all the different columns of data in Excel and ensure that the\\nformula in each cell is computed based on the rows above the cur-\\nrent row. It would be visually obvious when one is using current\\nday’s data in generating signals, given the cell-highlighting function-\\nality in Excel. (Double-clicking a cell with a formula will highlight\\nthe cells of data this formula utilizes.) With MATLAB, you have to\\nbe more careful and remember to run a lag function on certain se-\\nries used for signal generation.\\nEven with all the care and caution that goes into creating a\\nbacktest program without look-ahead bias, sometimes we may\\nstill let some of it slip in. Some look-ahead bias is quite subtle in\\nnature and not easy to avoid, especially if you are using MATLAB.'),\n",

Now truncate your historical data so\\nthat the most recent portion (sayN days) is removed. So if the last\\nday in the original data isT, then the last day in the truncated data\\nshould beT-N. N could be 10 days to 100 days. Now run the back-\\ntest program again using the truncated data and save the resulting\\npositions into a new ﬁle B. Truncate the most recentN rows of the\\npositions ﬁle A so that both A and B have the same number of rows\\n(days) in them, and the last day in both ﬁle A and B should beT-N.\\nFinally, check if A and B are identical in their positions. If not, you\\nhave a look-ahead bias in your backtest program that you must ﬁnd\\nand correct, because the discrepancies in positions mean that you\\nare inadvertently using the truncated part of the historical data (the\\npart that lies ahead of dayT-N) in determining the positions in ﬁle\\nA. I will illustrate this somewhat convoluted procedure at the end of\\nExample 3.6.\\nData-Snooping Bias\\nIn Chapter 2, I mentioned data-snooping bias—the danger that back-\\ntest performance is inﬂated relative to the future performance of\\nthe strategy because we have overoptimized the parameters of the\\nmodel based on transient noise in the historical data. Data snoop-\\ning bias is pervasive in the business of predictive statistical models\\nof historical data, but is especially serious in ﬁnance because of the\\nlimited amount of independent data we have. High-frequency data,\\nwhile in abundant supply, is useful only for high-frequency models.\\nAnd while we have stock market data stretching back to the early\\nparts of the twentieth century, only data within the past 10 years\\nare really suitable for building predictive model. Furthermore, as\\ndiscussed in Chapter 2, regime shifts may render even data that are\\njust a few years old obsolete for backtesting purposes. The less inde-\\npendent data you have, the fewer adjustable parameters you should\\nemploy in your trading model.'),\n",

Numerous choices one makes in creating a trad-\\ning model can be affected by repeated backtesting on the same\\ndata set—decisions such as whether to enter at the open or close,\\nwhether to hold the positions overnight, whether to trade large-cap\\nor mid-cap stocks. Often, these qualitative decisions are made to\\noptimize the backtest performance, but they may not be optimal go-\\ning forward. It is almost impossible to completely eliminate data-\\nsnooping bias as long as we are building data-driven models. How-\\never, there are ways to mitigate the bias.\\nSample Size The most basic safeguard against data-snooping bias\\nis to ensure that you have a sufﬁcient amount of backtest data rel-\\native to the number of free parameters you want to optimize. As a\\nrule of thumb, let’s assume that the number of data points needed\\nfor optimizing your parameters is equal to 252 times the number\\nof free parameters your model has. (This assumption of propor-\\ntionality is not based on any survey of the vast statistical litera-\\nture, but purely on experience.) So, for example, let’s assume you\\nhave a daily trading model with three parameters. Then you should\\nhave at least three years’ worth of backtest data with daily prices.\\nHowever, if you have a three-parameter trading model that updates\\npositions every minute, then you should have at least 252/390 year,\\nor about seven months, of one-minute backtest data. (Note that if\\nyou have a daily trading model, then even if you have seven months\\nof minute-by-minute data points, effectively you only have about\\n7 × 21 = 147 data points, far from sufﬁcient for testing a three-\\nparameter model.)\\nOut-of-Sample Testing Divide your historical data into two parts.\\nSave the second (more recent) part of the data for out-of-sample\\ntesting. When you build the model, optimize the parameters as well\\nas other qualitative decisions on the ﬁrst portion (called thetrain-\\ning set), but test the resulting model on the second portion (called'),\n",

(The two portions should be roughly equal in size, but if\\nthere is insufﬁcient training data, we should at least have one-third\\nas much test data as training data. The minimum size of the training\\nset is determined by the rule of thumb in the previous section.) Ide-\\nally, the set of optimal parameters and decisions for the ﬁrst part of\\nthe backtest period is also the optimal set for the second period, but\\nthings are rarely this perfect. The performance on the second part\\nof the data should at least be reasonable. Otherwise, the model has\\ndata-snooping bias built into it, and one way to cure it is to simplify\\nthe model and eliminate some parameters.\\nA more rigorous (albeit more computationally intensive)\\nmethod of out-of-sample testing is to use moving optimization of\\nthe parameters. In this case, the parameters themselves are con-\\nstantly adapting to the changing historical data, and data-snooping\\nbias with respect to parameters is eliminated. (See the sidebar on\\nparameterless trading models.)\\nPARAMETERLESS TRADING MODELS*\\nA portfolio manager whom I used to work for liked to proudly proclaim that\\nhis trading models have “no free parameters.” In keeping with the tradition of\\nsecrecy in our industry, he would not divulge his technique further.\\nLately, I have begun to understand what a trading model with no free pa-\\nrameters means. It doesn’t mean that it does not contain, for example, any\\nlookback period for calculating trends, or thresholds for entry or exit. I think\\nthat would be impossible. It just means that all such parameters aredynami-\\ncally optimized in a moving lookback window. This way, if you ask, “Does the\\nmodel have a ﬁxed proﬁt cap?,” the trader can honestly reply: “No, proﬁt cap is\\nnot an input parameter. It is determined by the model itself.”\\nThe advantage of a parameterless trading model is that it minimizes the\\ndanger of overﬁtting the model to multiple input parameters (the so-called\\n“data-snooping bias”). So the backtest performance should be much closer to\\nthe actual forward performance.\\n(Note that parameter optimization does not necessarily mean picking one\\nbest set of parameters that give the best backtest performance.

As a result, I personally have seldom traded parameter-\\nless models, until I get to research my regime-switching model described in\\nExample 7.1. That model is almost parameterless (I left out a few parameters\\nfrom optimization because of a lack of time, not because of any technical dif-\\nﬁculties). How was I able to perform backtest parameter optimization within a\\nfew minutes in this case? I got to use a high-end backtesting platform (Alphacet\\nDiscovery).\\n*This section was adapted from my blog article “Parameterless Trading Models,” which you\\ncan ﬁnd at epchan.blogspot.com/2008/05/parameterless-trading-models.html.\\nThe ultimate out-of-sample testing is familiar to many traders,\\nand it is calledpaper trading.Running the model on actual unseen\\ndata is the most reliable way to test it (short of actually trading it).\\nPaper trading not only allows you to perform a truly honest out-\\nof-sample test; it often allows you to discover look-ahead errors in\\nyour programs, as well as making you aware of various operational\\nissues. I will discuss paper trading in Chapter 5.\\nIf the strategy that you are testing comes from a published\\nsource, and you are just conducting a backtest to verify that the re-\\nsults are correct, then the entire period between the time of publi-\\ncation and the time that you tested the strategy is a genuine out-of-\\nsample period. As long as you do not optimize the parameters of the\\npublished model on the out-of-sample period, this period is as good\\nas paper trading the strategy.\\nExample 3.6: Pair Trading of GLD and GDX\\nThis example will illustrate how to separate the data into a training set and a\\ntest set. We will backtest a pair-trading strategy and optimize its parameters\\non the training set and look at the eﬀect on the test set.\\nGLD versus GDX is a good candidate for pair trading because GLD\\nreﬂects the spot price of gold, and GDX is a basket of gold-mining\\nstocks. It makes intuitive sense that their prices should move in tandem.\\nI have discussed this pair of ETFs extensively on my blog in connec-\\ntion with cointegration analysis (see, e.g., epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/'),\n",

And more important: Is there\\na corresponding decrease in performance on the test set as you\\neliminate the conditions?

It should not\\nsurprise you to ﬁnd that a strategy with a high Sharpe ratio before\\nadding transaction costs can become very unproﬁtable after adding\\nsuch costs. I will illustrate this in Example 3.7.\\nExample 3.7: A Simple Mean-Reverting Model with and\\nwithout Transaction Costs\\nHere is a simple mean-reverting model that is due to Amir Khan-\\ndani and Andrew Lo at MIT (available at web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/\\naugust07.pdf). This strategy is very simple: Buy the stocks with the worst\\nprevious one-day returns, and short the ones with the best previous one-\\nday returns. Despite its utter simplicity, this strategy has had great perfor-\\nmance since 1995, ignoring transaction costs (it has a Sharpe ratio of 4.47\\nin 2006). Our objective here is to ﬁnd out what would happen to its perfor-\\nmance in 2006 if we assume a standard 5-basis-point-per-trade transaction\\ncost. (A trade is deﬁned as a buy or a short, not a round-trip transaction.)\\nThis example strategy not only allows us to illustrate the impact of trans-\\naction costs, it also illustrates the power of MATLAB in backtesting a model\\nthat trades multiple securities—in other words, a typical statistical arbitrage\\nmodel. Backtesting a model with a large number of symbols over multiple\\nyears is often too cumbersome to perform in Excel. But even assuming that\\nyou have MATLAB at your disposal, there is still the question of how to re-\\ntrieve historical data for hundreds of symbols, especially survivorship-bias-\\nfree data. Here, we will put aside the question of survivorship bias because\\nof the expensive nature of such data and just bear in mind that whatever\\nperformance estimates we obtained are upper bounds on the actual perfor-\\nmance of the strategy.\\nWhenever one wants to backtest a stock selection strategy, the ﬁrst\\nquestion is always: Which universe of stocks? The typical starting point is\\nthe S&P 500 stock universe, which is the most liquid set of stocks avail-\\nable. The current list of stocks in the S&P 500 is available for download at\\nthe Standard & Poor’s website (www.standardandpoors.com). Since the con-\\nstituents of this universe change constantly, the list that you download will\\nbe diﬀerent from mine. For ease of comparison, you can ﬁnd my list saved\\nas epchan.com/book/SP500 20071121.xls. The easiest way to download\\nhistorical data for all these stocks is to buy a copy of the HQuote Pro soft-\\nware (referenced earlier in this chapter, available from HQuote.com.) This'),\n",

How to reﬁne a\\nstrategy without introducing data-snooping bias and to remain sim-\\nple with few parameters is more of an art than a science. The guid-\\ning principle is the same as that of parameter optimization: What-\\never changes you make to the strategy to improve its performance\\non the training set, it must also improve the performance on the\\ntest set.\\nOften, there are some very simple strategies that are fairly well\\nknown in traders’ circles and are still somewhat proﬁtable, though\\ntheir returns seem to be diminishing. An example is the pair trad-\\ning of stocks. The reason they are diminishing in returns is that too\\nmany traders are taking advantage of this arbitrage opportunity and\\ngradually erasing the proﬁt margin. However, it is often possible to\\nintroduce minor variations in the basic strategy, which will boost its\\nreturns.\\nThese minor variations are often far less well known than the\\nbasic strategy, and therefore far less well exploited by traders.\\nSometimes they involve excluding certain stocks or groups of stocks\\nfrom the universe. For example, traders often prefer to exclude'),\n",

Yet another variation concerns the selection of the stock uni-\\nverse: We saw in Example 3.7 that a strategy that has a very good\\nSharpe ratio when it is applied to small-cap stocks becomes very\\nunproﬁtable when applied to large-cap stocks.\\nWhen introducing these reﬁnements to your strategy, it is\\npreferable that the reﬁnement has some basis in fundamental eco-\\nnomics or a well-studied market phenomenon, rather than some\\narbitrary rule based on trial and error.

I will leave it as an exercise for\\nthe reader to improve the Sharpe ratio further by testing the strategy on\\nthe S&P 400 mid-cap and S&P 600 small-cap universes.\\nSUMMARY\\nBacktesting is about conducting a realistic historical simulation of\\nthe performance of a strategy.

Dark-pool liquid-\\nity is formed by institutional orders facilitated away from the ex-\\nchanges, or they come from the crossing of internal brokerage cus-\\ntomer orders. These orders are not displayed as bid and ask quotes.\\nSome of the “alternative trading systems” that provide dark-pool\\nliquidity are Liquidnet and ITG’s Posit. Your brokerage may use one\\nor more of these providers, it may only use its internal crossing net-\\nwork, or it may use no alternative trading systems at all.\\nSometimes, a better execution price at a large brokerage due\\nto its state-of-the-art execution system and high-speed access to\\ndeeper dark pools of liquidity will more than compensate for its\\nhigher commissions. This kind of cost/beneﬁt analysis cannot eas-\\nily be carried out unless you actually trade on multiple brokerages\\nsimultaneously and compare the actual execution costs.\\nFor example, I trade through Goldman Sachs’s REDIPlus trading\\nplatform, whose Sigma X execution engine routes orders to both its\\ninternal crossing network as well as to external liquidity providers.\\nI have found that it often improves my execution price by more than\\na few cents per share over execution on Interactive Brokers: more\\nthan enough to offset its higher commissions.\\nAnother consideration is the range of products you can trade.\\nMany retail brokerages or proprietary trading ﬁrms do not allow you\\nto trade futures or foreign currencies. This would be a serious limi-\\ntation to your trading business’s growth.\\nFollowing these two fairly generic criteria, for a quantitative\\ntrader, the next important one is: Does the trading platform offer an\\napplication programming interface (API) so that your trading soft-\\nware can receive live data feed, generate orders, and automatically\\ntransmit the orders for execution in your account? I will discuss\\nmore about API in Chapter 5. The only point to note here is that\\nwithout an API, high-frequency quantitative trading is impossible.\\nClosely related to the availability of API is the availability of pa-\\nper trading accounts. If a brokerage does not offer you a paper trad-\\ning account, it is very hard to test an API without risking real losses.\\nAmong the brokerages I know that offer paper trading accounts are\\nInteractive Brokers, Genesis Securities, PFG Futures (for futures\\ntrading), and Oanda (for currency trading).'),\n",

This does not\\nmatter to the choice of a retail brokerage because, as noted in Ta-\\nble 4.1, retail accounts are insured by the SIPC whereas proprietary\\naccounts are not. Hence, it is important that a proprietary trading\\nﬁrm has a strong balance sheet and good risk management practices\\nto prevent the ﬁrm from collapsing because of bad trades made by\\nits fellow member traders. (WorldCom’s and Refco’s collapses are\\ngood examples.) You should also make sure the ﬁrm is a broker-\\ndealer registered with an exchange, so that it is regularly audited by\\nthe exchange and the SEC. (As of this writing, non-broker-dealer\\nproprietary trading ﬁrms may all get shut down by the SEC any-\\nway, starting with Tuco Trading in March 2008.)

You are\\nfree to be a member of more than one proprietary ﬁrm, or have both\\nproprietary and retail trading accounts, as long as this fact is fully\\ndisclosed to the proprietary trading ﬁrms involved and to the NASD\\nas “outside business activities” and prior permissions obtained.

And, in\\nfact, sometimes each account has its own pros and cons, and you\\nmay want to have the ﬂexibility of keeping all of them open for trad-\\ning different strategies!\\nPHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\\nNow that you have set up the legal and administrative structure of\\nyour trading business, it is time to consider the physical infrastruc-\\nture. This applies to both retail and proprietary traders: Many pro-\\nprietary trading ﬁrms allow their members to trade remotely in their\\nhomes. If you are a proprietary trader who requires minimal coach-\\ning from your account manager and are conﬁdent in your ability to\\nset up the physical trading infrastructure yourself, there is no reason\\nnot to trade remotely.\\nIn the start-up phase of your business, the physical infrastruc-\\nture can be light and simple. You probably have all the compo-\\nnents you need in your home ofﬁce already: a good personal com-\\nputer (practically any new computer with dual-core processors will\\ndo), a high-speed (DSL or cable) Internet connection, and, less well\\nknown, an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) so that your com-\\nputer doesn’t get accidentally shut down in the middle of a trade be-\\ncause of electricity ﬂuctuations. The total initial investment should\\nnot exceed a couple of thousand dollars at the maximum, and the\\nmonthly cost should not be more than $50 or so if you don’t already\\nsubscribe to cable TV.\\nSome traders wonder if having a TV tuned to CNBC or CNN\\nis a good idea. While it certainly won’t hurt, many professional\\nquantitative traders have found that it is not necessary, as long as\\nthey also subscribe to another professional real-time newsfeed, such\\nas Thomson Reuters, Dow Jones, or Bloomberg. While Bloomberg\\ncan cost almost $2,000 a month, various plans offered by Thomson\\nReuters and Dow Jones can cost as little as $100 to $200 (though\\nsome will require an annual contract). Bloomberg also has a free\\nInternet radio stream at www.bloomberg.com/tvradio/radio that an-\\nnounces breaking business news and commentaries. Also, instead'),\n",

(SeeEconomist, 2007a, or Oldﬁeld, 2007.)\\nAs your trading business grows, you may upgrade your infra-\\nstructure gradually. Perhaps you will purchase faster computers. A\\nquad-core computer at the time of this writing is considered fairly\\nhigh end. Of course, when you are reading this, an octal-core or bet-\\nter personal computer will probably be widely available. According\\nto a New York Timesarticle (Markoff, 2007), PCs with octal-core\\nchips will be available as soon as 2010.\\nYou will certainly want to purchase multiple monitors to hook\\nup to the same computer so that you have extended screen space\\nto monitor all the different trading applications and portfolios.\\nMaybe you will want to upgrade your Internet connection to a T1\\nline, too. As discussed in Chapter 2, any delay in the transmis-\\nsion of your order to your brokerage results in slippage, which\\nis quite real in terms of lost proﬁts. In fast-moving markets, ev-\\nery millisecond counts, and an upgrade in your Internet connection\\nspeed may well pay for itself very quickly. (A T1 line can cost any-\\nwhere from $700 to $1,500, whereas a cable/DSL connection is usu-\\nally under $50. A T1 line transmits information at 1.5Mbps, where\\nbps means “bits per second,” about twice as fast as a cable/DSL\\nconnection.)\\nOnce you have ﬁnally tested your trading strategy and discover\\nthat it works in practice very well, it will be time to scale up the\\nbusiness and consider “business continuity planning” so that your\\ntrading strategy is resilient to common household disasters such as\\nInternet outage, electricity outage, ﬂooding, and so on. You can in-\\nstall your trading programs on a remote server located in a hosting\\ncompany; in fact, you can even “collocate” your computers contain-\\ning your trading programs at the hosting company.

For certain high-frequency systems, a fully\\nautomated system is indispensable, because any human interven-\\ntion will cause enough delay to seriously derail the performance.\\nHowever, a fully automated system is also complicated and costly\\nto build, often requiring professional programmers with knowledge\\nof high-performance programming languages such as Java, C#, or\\nC++in order to connect to your brokerage’s application program-\\nming interface (API).\\nFor lower-frequency quantitative trading strategies, there is a\\nsemiautomated alternative: One can generate the orders using pro-\\ngrams such as Excel or MATLAB, then submit those orders using\\nbuilt-in tools such as a basket trader or spread trader offered by your\\nbrokerage. If your brokerage provides a dynamic data exchange\\n(DDE) link to Excel (see below), you can also write a macro at-\\ntached to your Excel spreadsheet that allows you to submit orders\\nto the brokerage simply by running the macro. This way, there is\\nno need to build an application in a complicated programming lan-\\nguage. However, it does mean that you would have to perform quite\\na few manual steps in order to submit your orders.\\nWhether you have built a semiautomated or a fully automated\\ntrading system, there is often a need for input data beyond the prices\\nthat your brokerage or data vendor can readily provide you. For ex-\\nample, earnings estimates or dividends data are often not provided\\nas part of the real-time data stream. These nonprice data are typ-\\nically available free of charge from many web sites, but are usu-\\nally embedded in an HTML format and not readily usable. Hence,\\nan automated system also must be able to retrieve such web pages,\\nparse them, and reformat them into a tabular format that your trad-\\ning strategy can utilize. Such web page retrieval and parsing pro-\\ngrams can readily be implemented in MATLAB (see Example 3.1 in\\nChapter 3), or in other scripting languages such as Perl.\\nI will discuss some details of the two kinds of system in the\\nfollowing sections. I will also discuss how to hire a programming'),\n",

I then go to the spread trader, which already\\ncontains all these pairs that I have previously speciﬁed, and manu-\\nally adjust the limit prices based on the MATLAB output.

Your\\nbrokerage will usually provide API for some popular programming\\nlanguages such as Visual Basic, Java, C#, or C++, so your fully auto-\\nmated system must also be written in one of these languages. Unfor-\\ntunately, no brokerage that I know of provides an API for MATLAB.\\nHence, MATLAB cannot be used to build the order transmission por-\\ntion of an automated trading system.\\nTheoretically, a fully automated system can be constructed out\\nof an Excel spreadsheet and an attached macro: All you have to\\ndo is to create a loop in your macro so that it updates the cells\\nusing the DDE links and submit orders when appropriate contin-\\nuously throughout the day. Unfortunately, data updates through\\nDDE links are slow, and generally your brokerage limits the num-\\nber of symbols that you can update all at once. (Unless you have\\ngenerated a large amount of commissions in the previous trading\\nmonth, Interactive Brokers allows you to update only 100 sym-\\nbols by default.)

If you back-\\ntested on such a platform, then it is trivial to conﬁgure it so that\\nthe program will submit real orders to your account. This dispenses\\nwith the need to write your own software, whether for backtesting\\nor for automated execution. However, as I mentioned in Chapter 3,\\nthe drawback of such proprietary systems is that they are seldom as\\nﬂexible as a general-purpose programming language like MATLAB\\nor Java for the construction of your strategy. For instance, if you\\nwant to pursue a rather mathematically complex strategy based on\\nprincipal component analysis (such as the one in Example 7.4), it\\nwould be quite difﬁcult to backtest in TradeStation.

Instead of implementing an\\nexecution system yourself, you may ﬁnd that hiring a programming consultant\\nwill result in much less headache.\\nHiring a programming consultant does not have to be expensive. For an\\nexperienced programmer, the hourly fees may range from $50 to $100. Some-\\ntimes, you can negotiate a ﬁxed fee for the entire project ahead of time, and\\nI ﬁnd that most projects for independent traders can be done with $1,000 to\\n$5,000. If you have an account at one of the brokerages that supply you with\\nan API, the brokerage can often refer you to some programmers who have ex-\\nperience with their API. (Interactive Brokers, for example, has a special web\\npage that allows programming consultants to oﬀer their services.) You can also\\nlook around (or post a request) on elitetrader.com for such programmers. As a\\nlast resort, you can ﬁnd hundreds if not thousands of freelance programmers\\nadvertising themselves on craigslist.org.

Of course, you can have\\nthem sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs, downloadable for free at many\\nlegal document web sites), but it is almost impossible to ﬁnd out if the pro-\\ngrammers are in fact running your strategies in their personal accounts once\\nthe programs are implemented. There are several ways to address this concern.\\nFirst, as I mentioned before, most strategies that you may think are your\\nunique creations are actually quite well known to experienced traders. So,\\nwhether you like it or not, other people are already trading very similar strategies\\nand impacting your returns. Adding an extra trader or two, unless the trader\\nworks for an institutional money manager, is not likely to cause much more\\nimpact.\\nSecond, if you are trading a strategy that has a large capacity (e.g., most\\nfutures trading strategies), then the extra market impact from your rogue pro-\\ngrammer consultant will be minimal.\\nFinally, you can choose to compartmentalize your information and\\nimplementation—that is, you can hire diﬀerent programmers to build diﬀerent\\nparts of the automated trading strategy.

So in this case, the ﬁrst programmer does not know your strategy,\\nand the second programmer does not have the infrastructure to execute the\\nstrategy. Furthermore, neither programmer knows the actual parameter values\\nto use for your strategy.\\nMINIMIZING TRANSACTION COSTS\\nWe saw in Chapter 3 how transaction costs can impact a strategy’s\\nactual return. Besides changing your brokerage or proprietary trad-\\ning ﬁrm to one that charges a lower commission, there are a few\\nthings you can do in your execution method to minimize the trans-\\naction costs.\\nTo cut down on commissions, you can refrain from trading low-\\nprice stocks. Typically, institutional traders do not trade any stocks\\nwith prices lower than $5. Not only do low-price stocks increase\\nyour total commissions costs (since you need to buy or sell more\\nshares for a ﬁxed amount of capital), percentage-wise they also have\\na wider bid-ask spread and therefore increase your total liquidity\\ncosts.\\nIn order to minimize market impact cost, you should limit the\\nsize (number of shares) of your orders based on the liquidity of the\\nstock. One common measure of liquidity is the average daily volume\\n(it is your choice what lookback period you want to average over).\\nAs a rule of thumb, each order should not exceed 1 percent of the\\naverage daily volume. As an independent trader, you may think that\\nit is not easy to reach this 1 percent threshold, and you would be\\nright when the stock in question is a large-cap stock belonging to\\nthe S&P 500. However, you may be surprised by the low liquidity of\\nsome small-cap stocks out there.\\nFor example, at the time of this writing, IRN is a stock in the S&P\\n600 SmallCap Index. It has a three-month average volume of about\\n51,000, and it closed today at $4.45. So 1 percent of this average\\nvolume is just 510 shares, which are worth only $2,269!\\nAnother way to reduce market impact is to scale the size of your\\norders based on the market capitalization of a stock.

A linear scale (i.e., scaling the capital\\nof a stock to be linearly proportional to its market capitalization)\\nwould result in practically zero weights for most small- and micro-\\ncap stocks in your portfolio, and this will take away any beneﬁts of\\ndiversiﬁcation. If we were to use linear scale, the capital weight of\\nthe largest large-cap stock will be about 10,000 of the smallest small-\\ncap stock. To reap the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation, we should not al-\\nlow that ratio to be more than 10 or so, provided that the liquidity\\n(volume) constraint described above is also satisﬁed. If the capital\\nweight of a stock is proportional to the fourth root of its market cap,\\nit would do the trick.\\nThere is one other way to reduce market impact. Many insti-\\ntutional traders who desire to execute a large order will break it\\ndown into many smaller orders and execute them over time. This\\nmethod of trading will certainly reduce market impact; however,\\nit engenders another kind of transactions costs, namely, slippage.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, slippage is the difference between the\\nprice that triggers the trading signal and the average execution price\\nof the entire order. Because the order is executed over a period\\nof time, slippage can be quite large. Since reducing market impact\\nin this way may increase slippage, it is not really suitable for retail\\ntraders whose order size is usually not big enough to require this\\nremedy.\\nSometimes, however, slippage is outside of your control: Per-\\nhaps your brokerage’s execution speed is simply too slow, due to\\neither software issues (their software processes your orders too\\nslowly), risk control issues (your order has to be checked against\\nyour account’s buying power and pass various risk control criteria\\nbefore it can be routed to the exchange), or pipeline issues (the bro-\\nkerage’s speed of access to the exchanges). Or perhaps your bro-\\nkerage does not have access to deep enough “dark-pool” liquidity.\\nThese execution costs and issues should affect your choice of bro-\\nkerages, as I pointed out in Chapter 4.'),\n",

Whether you win or lose,\\nyou understand that it will take a while to ﬁnd out if its performance\\nmeets your expectations. But what if after one month, then two\\nmonths, and then ﬁnally a quarter has passed, the strategy still de-\\nlivers a meager or maybe even negative returns. This disappointing\\nexperience is common to freshly minted quantitative traders. This\\nwould be the time to review the list of what possibly may have\\ncaused this divergence from expectation. Start with the simplest\\ndiagnosis:\\nr Do you have bugs in your ATS software?\\nr Do the trades generated by your ATS match the ones generated\\nby your backtest program?\\nr Are the execution costs much higher than what you expected?\\nr Are you trading illiquid stocks that caused a lot of market im-\\npact?\\nIf the execution costs are much higher than what you expected,\\nit may be worthwhile to reread the section on how to minimize trans-\\naction costs again.'),\n",

If the backtest performance\\ncompletely fell apart after this exercise, chances are you do have\\nthis bias and it is time to look for a new strategy. If the backtest\\nperformance is still reasonable, your poor live trading performance\\nmay just be due to bad luck.\\nRegime shifts refer to the situation when the ﬁnancial market\\nstructure or the macroeconomic environment undergoes a drastic\\nchange so much so that trading strategies that were proﬁtable be-\\nfore may not be proﬁtable now.\\nThere are two noteworthy regime shifts in recent years re-\\nlated to market (or regulatory) structure that may affect certain\\nstrategies.\\nThe ﬁrst one is the decimalization of stock prices. Prior to early\\n2001, stock prices in the United States were quoted in multiples of\\none-sixteenth and one-eighteenth of a penny. Since April 9, 2001, all\\nU.S. stocks have been quoted in decimals. This seemingly innocuous\\nchange has had a dramatic impact on the market structure, which\\nis particularly negative for the proﬁtability of statistical arbitrage\\nstrategies.\\nThe reason for this may be worthy of a book unto itself. In a\\nnutshell, decimalization reduces frictions in the price discovery pro-\\ncess, while statistical arbitrageurs mostly act as market makers and\\nderive their proﬁts from frictions and inefﬁciencies in this process.\\n(This is the explanation given by Dr. Andrew Sterge in a Columbia\\nUniversity ﬁnancial engineering seminar titled “Where Have All the\\nStat Arb Proﬁts Gone?” in January 2008. Other industry practitioners\\nhave made the same point to me in private conversations.) Hence,\\nwe can expect backtest performance of statistical arbitrage strate-\\ngies prior to 2001 to be far superior to their present-day perfor-\\nmance.\\nThe other regime shift is relevant if your strategy shorts\\nstocks.'),\n",

This plus-tick rule\\nwas eliminated by the SEC in June 2007. Therefore, your backtest\\nresults for a strategy that shorts stocks may show an artiﬁcially in-\\nﬂated performance prior to 2007 relative to their actual realizable\\nperformance in those days.\\nActually, there is another problem with realizing the backtest\\nperformance of a strategy that shorts stocks apart from this regula-\\ntory regime shift. Even without the plus-tick rule, many stocks, es-\\npecially the small-cap ones or the ones with low liquidity, are “hard\\nto borrow.” For you to be able to short a stock, your broker has to\\nbe able to borrow it from someone else (usually a large mutual fund\\nor other brokerage clients) and lend it to you for selling. If no one is\\nable or willing to lend you their stock, it is deemed hard to borrow\\nand you would not be able to short it. Hence, again, a very proﬁtable\\nhistorical short position may not actually have been possible due to\\nthe difﬁculty of borrowing the stock.\\nThe two regime shifts described here are the obvious and well-\\npublicized ones. However, there may be other, more subtle regime\\nshifts that apply to your category of stocks that few people know\\nabout, but is no less disruptive to the proﬁtability of your strategy’s\\nperformance.

Dr. Edward Thorp, whom I mentioned in the pref-\\nace, has written an excellent expository article on this subject in one\\nof his papers (Thorp, 1997), and I shall follow his discussion closely\\nin this chapter. (Dr. Thorp’s discussion is centered on a portfolio of\\nsecurities, and mine is constructed around a portfolio of strategies.\\nHowever, the mathematics are almost identical.)\\nEvery optimization problem begins with an objective. Our ob-\\njective here is to maximize our long-term wealth—an objective that\\nI believe is not controversial for the individual investor. Maximiz-\\ning long-term wealth is equivalent to maximizing the long-term com-\\npounded growth rateg of your portfolio. Note that this objective im-\\nplicitly means that ruin (i.e., equity’s going to zero or less because of\\na loss) must be avoided. This is because if ruin can be reached with\\nnonzero probability at some point, the long-term wealth is surely\\nzero, as is the long-term growth rate.\\n(In all of the discussions, I assume that we reinvest all trading\\nproﬁts, and therefore it is the levered, compounded growth rate that\\nis of ultimate importance.)\\nOne approximation that I will make is that the probability dis-\\ntribution of the returns of each of the trading strategyi is Gaussian,\\nwith a ﬁxed meanmi and standard deviationsi. (The returns should\\nbe net of all ﬁnancing costs; that is, they should be excess returns.)\\nThis is a common approximation in ﬁnance, but it can be quite\\ninaccurate.

Here is the simple mathematical embodiment\\nof this fact.\\nExample 6.2: Calculating the Optimal Leverage Based on the\\nKelly Formula\\nLet’s see an example of the Kelly formula at work. Suppose our portfolio\\nconsists of just a long position in SPY, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) track-\\ning the S&P 500 index. Let’s suppose that the mean annual return of SPY is\\n11.23 percent, with an annualized standard deviation of 16.91 percent, and\\nthat the risk-free rate is 4 percent. Hence, the portfolio has an annual mean\\nexcess return of 7.231 percent and an annual standard deviation of 16.91\\npercent, giving it a Sharpe ratio of 0.4275. The optimal leverage according\\nto the Kelly formula is f = 0.07231/0.16912 = 2.528. (Notice one inter-\\nesting tidbit: The Kelly f is independent of time scale, so it actually does\\nnot matter whether you annualize your return and standard deviation, as\\nopposed to Sharpe ratio which is time scale dependent.) Finally, the annu-\\nalized compounded, levered growth rate is 13.14 percent, which includes\\nthe ﬁnancing costs.\\nYou can verify these numbers yourselves by downloading the SPY daily\\nprices from Yahoo! Finance and computing the various quantities on a\\nspreadsheet. I did that on December 29, 2007, and my spreadsheet is avail-\\nable at epchan.com/book/example6 2.xls. In column H, I have computed\\nthe daily returns of the (adjusted) closing prices of SPY, while in row 3760\\nstarting at column H, I have computed the (annualized) mean return of\\nSPY, the standard deviation of SPY, the mean excess return of the portfo-\\nlio, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, the Kelly leverage, and, ﬁnally, the\\ncompounded growth rate.\\nThe Kelly leverage of 2.528 that we computed is saying that, for this\\nstrategy, if you have $100,000 in cash to invest, and if you really be-\\nlieve the expected values of your returns and standard deviations, you\\nshould borrow money to buy $252,800 worth of SPY.

Because the optimal leverage of 2.528 times the current equity\\nof $74,720 is $188,892.\\nAs a practical procedure, this continuous updating of the capi-\\ntal allocation should occur at least once at the end of each trading\\nday. In addition to updating the capital allocation, one should also\\nperiodically update F* itself by recalculating the most recent trail-\\ning mean return and standard deviation. What should the lookback\\nperiod be and how often do you need to update these inputs to the\\nKelly formula? These depend on the average holding period of your\\nstrategy. If you hold your positions for only one day or so, then as a\\nrule of thumb, I would advise using a lookback period of six months.\\nUsing a relatively short lookback period has the advantage of allow-\\ning you to gradually reduce your exposure to strategies that have\\nbeen losing their performance. As for the frequency of update, it\\nshould not be a burden to updateF* daily once you have written a\\nprogram to do so.\\nOne last point: Some strategies generate a variable number of\\ntrading signals each day, which may result in a variable number of\\npositions and thus total capital each day. How should the Kelly for-\\nmula be used to determine the capital in this case when we don’t\\nknow what it will be beforehand?

In fact, the\\nSPY example (6.2) illustrated that the Kelly formula would advise\\nyou to reduce the portfolio size in the face of trading losses.

(The other face of the coin is that optimal leverage dic-\\ntates that you should increase your position size when your strategy\\ngenerates proﬁts.) This kind of selling is believed by some analysts\\nto be the cause of “ﬁnancial contagion” affecting many large hedge\\nfunds simultaneously when one faces a large loss.\\nAn example of this is the summer 2007 meltdown, described in\\nthe previously cited article “What Happened to the Quants in Au-\\ngust 2007?” by Amir Khandani and Andrew Lo. During August 2007,\\nunder the ominous cloud of a housing and mortgage default crisis,\\na number of well-known hedge funds experienced unprecedented\\nlosses, with Goldman Sachs’s Global Alpha fund falling 22.5 per-\\ncent. Several billion dollars evaporated within all of one week. Even\\nRenaissance Technologies Corporation, arguably the most success-\\nful quantitative hedge fund of all time, lost 8.7 percent in the ﬁrst\\nhalf of August, though it later recovered most of it. Not only is the\\nmagnitude of the loss astounding, but the widespread nature of it\\nwas causing great concern in the ﬁnancial community. Strangest of\\nall, few of these funds hold any mortgage-backed securities at all,\\nostensibly the root cause of the panic. It therefore became a classic\\nstudy of ﬁnancial contagion as propagated by hedge funds.\\nThis kind of contagion occurs because a large loss by one hedge\\nfund causes it to sell off some large positions that it holds (whether\\nor not these are the positions that cause the loss in the ﬁrst place).\\nThis selling causes the prices of the securities to drop (or rise in\\nthe case of short positions). If other hedge funds are holding sim-\\nilar positions, they will then suffer large losses also, causing their\\nown risk management system to sell off their own positions, and on\\nand on. For example, in the summer of 2007, one large hedge fund\\nmight have been holding subprime mortgage-backed securities and\\nsuffered a large loss in that sector. Risk management then required\\nthat it sold off liquid stock positions in their portfolio which might,\\nup to that point, be unaffected by the subprime debacle. Because of\\nthe selling of such stock positions, other statistical arbitrage hedge\\nfunds that hold no mortgage-backed securities might now suffered\\nbig losses, and proceeded to sell their stocks as well.

A lower leverage\\nimplies a smaller size of the selling required for risk management.\\nSometimes, even taking the conservative half-Kelly formula may\\nbe too aggressive, and traders may want to limit their portfolio\\nsize further by additional constraints. This is because, as I pointed\\nout previously, the application of the Kelly formula to continuous\\nﬁnance is premised on the assumption that return distribution is\\nGaussian. (Finance is continuous in the sense that the outcomes of\\nmaking bets in the ﬁnancial market fall on a continuum of proﬁts or\\nlosses, as opposed to a game of cards where the outcomes fall into\\ndiscrete cases.) But, of course, the returns are not really Gaussian:\\nlarge losses occur at far higher frequencies than would be predicted\\nby a nice bell-shaped curve. Some people refer to the true distri-\\nbutions of returns as having “fat tails.” What this means is that the\\nprobability of an event far, far away from the mean is much higher\\nthan allowed by the Gaussian bell curve. These highly improbable\\nevents have been called “black swan” events by the author Nassim\\nTaleb (see Taleb, 2007).\\nTo handle extreme events that fall outside the Gaussian distri-\\nbution, we can use our simple backtest technique to roughly esti-\\nmate what the maximum one-period loss was historically. (The pe-\\nriod may be one week, one day, or one hour. The only criterion to\\nuse is that you should be ready to rebalance your portfolio accord-\\ning to the Kelly formula at the end of every period.) You should also\\nhave in mind what is the maximum one-period drawdown on your\\nequity that you are willing to suffer. Dividing the maximum tolera-\\nble one-period drawdown on equity by the maximum historical loss\\nwill tell you whether even half-Kelly leverage is too large for your\\ncomfort. The leverage to use is always the smaller of the half-Kelly\\nleverage and the maximum leverage obtained using the worst histor-\\nical loss.

Meanwhile, the leverage\\nrecommended by half-Kelly is 1.26. Hence, in this case, even half-\\nKelly leverage wouldnot be conservative enough to survive Black\\nMonday.\\nThe truly scary scenario in risk management is the one that\\nhas not occurred in history before. Echoing the philosopher Lud-\\nwig Wittgenstein, “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be\\nsilent”—on such unknowables, theoretical models are appropriately\\nsilent.\\nIS THE USE OF STOP LOSS A GOOD RISK\\nMANAGEMENT PRACTICE?\\nSome traders believe that good risk management means imposing stop loss on\\nevery trade; that is, if a position incurs a certain percent loss, the trader will\\nexit the position. It is a common fallacy to believe that imposing stop loss will\\nprevent the portfolio from suﬀering catastrophic losses. When a catastrophic\\nevent occurs, securities prices will drop discontinuously, so the stop loss orders\\nto exit the positions will only be ﬁlled at prices much worse than those before\\nthe event. So, by exiting the positions, we are actually realizing the catastrophic\\nloss and not avoiding it. For stop loss to be beneﬁcial, we must believe that we\\nare in a momentum, or trending, regime. In other words, we must believe that\\nthe prices will get worse within the expected lifetime of our trade. Otherwise, if\\nthe market is mean reverting within that lifetime, we will eventually recoup our\\nlosses if we didn’t exit the position too quickly.\\nOf course, it is not easy to tell whether one is in a momentum regime (when\\nstop loss is beneﬁcial) or in a mean-reverting regime (when stop loss is harm-\\nful). My own observation is that when the movement of prices is due to news\\nor other fundamental reasons (such as a company’s deteriorating revenue), one\\nis likely to be in a momentum regime, and one should not “stand in front of\\na freight train,” in traders’ vernacular. For example, if a fundamental analysis\\nof a company reveals that it is currently overvalued, its stock price will likely\\ngradually decrease (at least in relation to the market index) in order to reach\\na new, lower equilibrium price. This movement to the lower equilibrium price\\nis irreversible as long as the fundamental economics of the company does not\\nchange. However, when securities prices move drastically without any apparent\\nnews or reasons, it is likely that the move is the result of a liquidity event—for\\nexample, major holders of the securities suddenly need to liquidate large'),\n",

It could be wrong for a large number of\\nreasons, some of which were detailed in Chapter 3: data-snooping\\nbias, survivorship bias, and so on.

This is the\\nregime shift that I talked about in Chapter 5.\\nThere is not much you can do to alleviate these sources of model\\nrisk, except to gradually lower the leverage of the model as it racks\\nup losses, up to the point where the leverage is zero. This can be ac-\\ncomplished in a systematic way if you constantly update the lever-\\nage according to the Kelly formula based on the trailing mean return\\nand standard deviation. (As the mean return decreases to zero in the\\nlookback period, your Kelly leverage will be driven to zero.)

I discussed the way to eliminate such soft-\\nware errors in Chapter 5: you should compare the trades generated\\nby your automated trading system with the theoretical trades gener-\\nated by your backtest system to ensure that they are the same.\\nFinally, physical or natural disasters can happen, which can\\ncause big losses, and they don’t have to be anything dramatic like\\nearthquakes or tsunami. What if your Internet connection went\\ndown before you could enter a hedging position? What if your power\\nwent down in the middle of transmitting a trade? The different meth-\\nods of preventing physical disasters from causing major disruptions\\nto your trading can be found in the section on physical infrastruc-\\nture in Chapter 4.\\nPSYCHOLOGICAL PREPAREDNESS\\nIt may seem strange that a book on quantitative trading would in-\\nclude a section on psychological preparedness. After all, isn’t quan-\\ntitative trading supposed to liberate us from our emotions and let the\\ncomputer make all the trading decisions in a disciplined manner? If\\nonly it were this easy: human traders who are not psychologically\\nprepared will often override their automated trading systems’ deci-\\nsions, especially when there is a position or day with abnormal proﬁt\\nor loss. Hence, it is critical even if we trade using quantitative strate-\\ngies to understand some of our own psychological weaknesses.\\nFortunately, there is a ﬁeld of ﬁnancial research called “behav-\\nioral ﬁnance” (Thaler, 1994) that studies irrational ﬁnancial decision\\nmaking. I will try to highlight a few of the common irrational behav-\\niors that affect trading.\\nThe ﬁrst behavioral bias is known variously as theendowment\\neffect, status quo bias,o rloss aversion. The ﬁrst two effects cause\\nsome traders to hold on to a losing position for too long, because\\ntraders (and people in general) give too much preference to the sta-\\ntus quo (the status quo bias), or because they demand much more'),\n",

As I argued in the risk management section, there\\nare rational reasons to hold on to a losing position (e.g., when you\\nexpect mean-reverting behavior); however, these behavioral biases\\ncause traders to hold on to losing positions even when there is no\\nrational reason (e.g., when you expect trending behavior, and the\\ntrend is such that your positions will lose even more). At the same\\ntime, the loss aversion bias causes some traders to exit their prof-\\nitable positions too soon, even if holding longer will lead to a larger\\nproﬁt on average. Why do they exit the proﬁtable positions so soon?\\nBecause the pain from possibly losing some of the current proﬁts\\noutweighs the pleasure from gaining higher proﬁts.\\nThis behavioral bias manifests itself most clearly and most dis-\\nastrously when one has entered a position by mistake (because of\\neither a software bug, an operational error, or a data problem) and\\nhas incurred a big loss. The rational step to take is to exit the po-\\nsition immediately upon discovery of the error. However, traders\\nare often tempted to wait for mean reversion such that the loss is\\nsmaller before they exit. Unless you have a model for mean rever-\\nsion that suggests now is a good time to enter into this position,\\nthis wait for mean reversion may very well lead to bigger losses\\ninstead.\\nAnother common bias that I have personally experienced is the\\n“representativeness bias”—people tend to put too much weight on\\nrecent experience and underweight long-term average (Ritter, 2003).\\n(This reference has a good introduction to various biases studied\\nby behavioral ﬁnance.) After a big loss, traders—even quantitative\\ntraders—tend to immediately modify certain parameters of their\\nstrategies so that they would have avoided the big loss if they were\\nto trade this modiﬁed system. But, of course, this is unwise because\\nthis modiﬁcation may invite some other big loss that is yet to hap-\\npen, or it may have eliminated many proﬁt opportunities that ex-\\nisted. We must remember that we are operating in a probabilistic\\nregime: No system can avoid all the market vagaries that can result\\nin losses.\\nIf you feel that your system really is deﬁcient and want to tweak\\nit, you should always backtest the modiﬁed version to make sure'),\n",

Many traders (and their managers, investors, etc.) will\\nbe under great pressure under this circumstance to shut down the\\nmodel completely. Other overly self-conﬁdent traders with a reck-\\nless bent will do the opposite: They will double their bets on their\\nlosing models, hoping to recoup their losses eventually, if and when\\nthe models rebound. Neither behavior is rational: if you have been\\nmanaging your capital allocation and leverage by the Kelly for-\\nmula, you would lower the capital allocation for the losing model\\ngradually.\\nGreed is the more usual emotion when the model is having a\\ngood run and is generating a lot of proﬁts. The temptation now is to\\nincrease its leverage quickly in order to get rich quickly. Once again,\\na well-disciplined quantitative trader will keep the leverage below\\nthe dictates of the Kelly formula as well as the caution imposed by\\nthe possibility of fat-tail events.\\nBoth despair and greed can lead to overleveraging (i.e., trad-\\ning an overly large portfolio): In despair, one tries to recoup the\\nlosses by adding fresh capital; in greed, one adds capital too\\nquickly after initial successes with a strategy. Therefore, the one\\ngolden rule in risk management is to keep the size of your port-\\nfolio under control at all times. This is, however, easier said than\\ndone. Large, well-known funds have succumbed to the tempta-\\ntion to overleverage and failed: Long-Term Capital Management in\\n2000 (Lowenstein, 2000) and Amaranth Advisors in 2006 (epchan.\\nblogspot.com/2006/10/highly-improbable-event.html). In the Ama-\\nranth Advisors case, the leverage employed on one single strategy\\n(natural gas calendar spread trade) due to one single trader (Brian\\nHunter) is so large that a $6 billion dollar loss was incurred, com-\\nfortably wiping out the fund’s equity—a textbook case of risk mis-\\nmanagement.\\nI have experienced this pressure myself both in an institutional\\nsetting and in a personal setting, and the unfortunate result both'),\n",

When I was with a money man-\\nagement ﬁrm, I lost over $1 million for the fund’s investors because,\\nin a ﬁt of greed, I added over $100 million to a portfolio based on a\\nstrategy that had been traded for barely six months. (That was be-\\nfore I learned of the Kelly criterion.) As if this is not enough lesson,\\nI repeated the same mistake again when I started trading indepen-\\ndently. It concerns a mean-reverting spread strategy involving XLE,\\nan energy exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the crude oil future (CL).\\nWhen the spread refused to mean revert over time, I stubbornly in-\\ncreased the size of the spread to almost $500,000. Finally, despair\\nset in, and I exited the spread with close to a six-ﬁgure loss. Natu-\\nrally, the spread started to revert afterward when I wasn’t around to\\nbeneﬁt.

Otherwise, they are random-\\nwalking, and trading will be futile. If you believe that prices are mean\\nreverting and that they are currently low relative to some reference\\nprice, you should buy now and plan to sell higher later. However, if\\nyou believe the prices are trending and that they are currently low,\\nyou should (short) sell now and plan to buy at an even lower price\\nlater. The opposite is true if you believe prices are high.\\nAcademic research has indicated that stock prices areon av-\\nerage very close to random walking. However, this does not mean\\nthat under certain special conditions, they cannot exhibit some de-\\ngree of mean reversion or trending behavior. Furthermore, at any\\ngiven time, stock prices can be both mean reverting and trending\\ndepending on the time horizon you are interested in. Constructing a\\ntrading strategy is essentially a matter of determining if the prices\\nunder certain conditions and for a certain time horizon will be mean\\nreverting or trending, and what the initial reference price should be\\nat any given time. (When the prices are trending, they are also said\\nto have “momentum,” and thus the corresponding trading strategy\\nis often called amomentum strategy.)\\nSome people like to describe the phenomenon that prices can\\nbe both mean reverting and trending at the same time as the “frac-\\ntal” nature of stock prices. Technical analysts or chartists like to\\nuse the so-called Elliott wave theory to analyze such phenomena.\\nStill others like to use the discipline of machine learning or artiﬁ-\\ncial intelligence (in particular, techniques such as hidden Markov\\nmodels, Kalman ﬁlter, neural networks, etc.) to discover whether\\nthe prices are in a mean-reverting or trending “regime.” I person-\\nally have not found such general theories of mean reversion or mo-\\nmentum particularly useful. (See, however, the section on regime\\nswitching, which describes an apparently successful attempt to pre-\\ndict regime switch for one particular stock.) Rather, I ﬁnd it is usu-\\nally safe to assume that, unless the expected earnings of a company'),\n",

In fact, ﬁnancial\\nresearchers (Khandani and Lo, 2007) have constructed a very simple\\nshort-term mean reversal model that is proﬁtable (before transac-\\ntion costs) over many years. Of course, whether the mean reversion\\nis strong enough and consistent enough such that we can trade prof-\\nitably after factoring in transaction costs is another matter, and it is\\nup to you, the trader, to ﬁnd those special circumstances when it is\\nstrong and consistent.\\nThough mean reversion is quite prevalent, backtesting a prof-\\nitable mean-reverting strategy can be quite perilous.\\nMany historical ﬁnancial databases contain errors in price\\nquotes. Any such error tends to artiﬁcially inﬂate the performance\\nof mean-reverting strategies. It is easy to see why: a mean-reverting\\nstrategy will buy on a ﬁctitious quote that is much lower than some\\nmoving average and sell on the next correct quote that is in line with\\nthe moving average and thus makes a proﬁt. One must make sure the\\ndata is thoroughly cleansed of such ﬁctitious quotes before one can\\ncompletely trust your backtesting performance on a mean-reverting\\nstrategy.\\nSurvivorship bias also affects the backtesting of mean-reverting\\nstrategies disproportionately, as I discussed in Chapter 3. Stocks\\nthat went through extreme price actions are likely to be either ac-\\nquired (the prices went very high) or went bankrupt (the prices\\nwent to zeros). A mean-reverting strategy will short the former and\\nbuy the latter, losing money in both cases. However, these stocks\\nmay not appear at all in your historical database if it has survivor-\\nship bias, thus artiﬁcially inﬂating your backtest performance. You\\ncan look up Table 3.1 to ﬁnd out which database has survivor-\\nship bias.\\nMomentum can be generated by the slow diffusion of\\ninformation—as more people become aware of certain news, more\\npeople decide to buy or sell a stock, thereby driving the price in\\nthe same direction.

And indeed, this leads to\\na momentum strategy calledpost earnings announcement drift,or\\nPEAD. (For a particularly useful article with lots of references on\\nthis strategy, look up quantlogic.blogspot.com/2006/03/pocket-phd-\\npost-earning-announcment.html.) Essentially, this strategy recom-\\nmends that you buy a stock when its earnings exceed expectations,\\nand short a stock when it falls short. More generally, many news an-\\nnouncements have the potential of altering expectations of a stock’s\\nfuture earnings, and therefore have the potential to trigger a trend-\\ning period. As to what kind of news will trigger this, and how long\\nthe trending period will last, it is again up to you to ﬁnd out.\\nBesides the slow diffusion of information, momentum can be\\ncaused by the incremental execution of a large order due to the li-\\nquidity needs or private investment decisions of a large investor.\\nThis cause probably accounts for more instances of short-term mo-\\nmentum than any other causes. With the advent of increasingly so-\\nphisticated execution algorithms adopted by the large brokerages, it\\nis, however, increasingly difﬁcult to ascertain whether a large order\\nis behind the observed momentum.\\nMomentum can also be generated by the herdlike behavior of in-\\nvestors: investors interpret the (possibly random and meaningless)\\nbuying or selling decisions of others as the sole justiﬁcations of their\\nown trading decisions. As Yale economist Robert Schiller said in the\\nNew York Times(Schiller, 2008), nobody has all the information\\nthey need in order to make a fully informed ﬁnancial decision. One\\nhas to rely on the judgment of others. There is, however, no sure\\nway to discern the quality of the judgment of others. More problem-\\natically, people make their ﬁnancial decisions at different times, not\\nmeeting at a town hall and reaching a consensus once and for all.\\nThe ﬁrst person who paid a high price for a house is “informing”\\nthe others that houses are good investments, which leads another\\nperson to make the same decision, and so on. Thus, a possibly erro-\\nneous decision by the ﬁrst buyer is propagated as “information” to a\\nherd of others.\\nUnfortunately, momentum regimes generated by these two\\ncauses (private liquidity needs and herdlike behavior) have highly'),\n",

When the number of arbitrage op-\\nportunities has been reduced to almost zero, the mean-reverting\\nstrategy is subject to the risk that an increasing percentage of\\ntrading signals are actually due to fundamental changes in stocks’\\nvaluation and thus is not going to mean revert. For momentum\\nstrategies, the effect of competition is often the diminishing of the\\ntime horizon over which the trend will continue.

If only\\nit were that easy. The difﬁculty with predicting this type of switch-\\ning encourages researchers to look more broadly at other types of\\nregime switching in the ﬁnancial markets, hoping to ﬁnd some that\\nmay be more amenable to existing statistical tools.\\nI have already described two regime switches (or “shifts,” for\\nthese two examples did not switch back to their former regimes)\\nthat are due to changes in market and regulatory structures: deci-\\nmalization of stock prices in 2003 and the elimination of the short-\\nsale plus-tick rule in 2007. (See Chapter 5 for details.) These regime\\nshifts are preannounced by the government, so no predictions of\\nthe shifts are necessary, though few people can predict the exact\\nconsequences of the regulatory changes.\\nSome of the other most common ﬁnancial or economic regimes\\nstudied are inﬂationary vs. recessionary regimes, high- vs. low-\\nvolatility regimes, and mean-reverting vs. trending regimes. Among\\nthese, volatility regime switching seems to be most amenable to\\nclassical econometric tools such as the generalized autoregres-\\nsive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model (See Klaassen,\\n2002). That is not surprising, as there is a long history of success\\namong ﬁnancial economists in modeling volatilities as opposed to\\nthe underlying stock prices themselves. While such predictions of\\nvolatility regime switches can be of great value to options traders,\\nthey are unfortunately of no help to stock traders.\\nAcademic attempts to model regime switches in stock prices\\ngenerally proceed along these lines:\\n1. Propose that the two (or more) regimes are characterized by\\ndifferent probability distributions of the prices. In the simplest\\ncases, the log of the prices of both regimes may be represented\\nby normal distributions, except that they have different means\\nand/or standard deviations.\\n2.

Based on the ﬁtted model above, ﬁnd out the expected regime\\nof the next time step and, more importantly, the expected stock\\nprice.\\nThis type of approach is usually calledMarkov regime switch-\\ning or hidden Markov models, and it is generally based on a\\nBayesian probabilistic framework. Readers who are interested in\\nreading more about some of these approaches may peruse Nielsen\\nand Olesen (2000), van Norden and Schaller (1993), or Kaufmann\\nand Scheicher (1996).\\nDespite the elegant theoretical framework, such Markov regime-\\nswitching models are generally useless for actual trading purposes.\\nThe reason for this weakness is that they assume constant tran-\\nsition probabilities among regimes at all times. In practice, this\\nmeans that at any time (as illustrated by the Nielsen and Olesen pa-\\nper), there is always a very small probability for the stock to tran-\\nsition from a normal, quiescent regime to a volatile regime. But this\\nis useless to traders who want to know when—and under what pre-\\ncise conditions—the transition probability will suddenly peak. This\\nquestion is tackled by the turning points models.\\nTurning points models take a data mining approach (Chai, 2007):\\nEnter all possible variables that might predict a turning point or\\nregime switch. Variables such as current volatility; last-period re-\\nturn; or changes in macroeconomic numbers such as consumer con-\\nﬁdence, oil price changes, bond price changes, and so on can all\\nbe part of this input. In fact, in a very topical article about turning\\npoints in the real estate market by economist Robert Schiller (2007),\\nit was suggested that the crescendo of media chatter about impend-\\ning boom or bust may actually be a good predictor of a coming turn-\\ning point.\\nIn Example 7.1, I illustrate how we might detect turning points\\nusing a data-mining approach with just simple technical indicators\\nbuilt on stock price series as inputs while using stock returns of\\nmultiple holding periods as outputs.'),\n",

This is nor-\\nmally a very onerous task, even with MATLAB. But, luckily, a recent machine\\nlearning program has enabled this discovery process to be done in a matter\\nof hours.\\nI shall employ a tool here called Alphacet Discovery, which is an inte-\\ngrated backtesting and execution platform recently launched by Alphacet,\\nInc. (www.alphacet.com. Full disclosure: Alphacet is a client of my ﬁrm.)\\nThis platform not only integrates all historical and real-time data needed\\nfor rapid strategy prototyping, backtesting, analysis, and real-time deploy-\\nment; it also contains an expanding array of machine learning programs\\nsuch as neural networks and genetic algorithms that are well suited to data\\nmining for the kind of relationships we are seeking.\\nI will pick a prominent brokerage stock—GS—as a proxy for the ﬁnan-\\ncial sector. My objective is to ﬁnd out if I can detect turning points in this\\nsector where it goes from bull to bear and back. My initial hypothesis is that\\nmajor shifts of interest rates, a release of government macroeconomic data,\\nor earnings announcements are likely triggers of turning points. At the time\\nof this writing, Alphacet had not yet completed integration of macroeco-\\nnomic or company news data into its database, so I will use a large percent\\nchange in GS as proxy for such news releases. Furthermore, I believe that\\nwhenever GS reaches an N-day high or low just before this large drop or\\nrise in prices occurs is a good signal that a previous regime is close to an\\nend. So I shall use this condition as an additional input as well.\\nThe search problem we face is: How large a percent change is suﬃcient\\nto trigger a regime switch? What should N be in the N-day high/low con-\\ndition? And how long does the new regime generally last? (In other words,\\nwhat is the optimal holding period?) To answer these questions in the old-\\nfashioned, manual way is very time consuming, as one has to run multi-\\nple simulations with diﬀerent thresholds for the independent variables and\\nmultiple return horizons for the dependent variables. Let’s see if Alphacet\\nDiscovery can help us automate this process.\\nThe independent variables of the model are just the one-day returns\\nof GS. The dependent variables are the future returns of GS within various\\nholding periods. Discovery can easily ﬁnd an optimal rule, or an optimal\\ncombination of rules, which will lead to the best backtest performance. In\\nour case, each percent-change threshold can be encapsulated as a rule. I\\nentered two thresholds for buys and two for shorts:−1p e r c e n t ,−3p e r c e n t ,'),\n",

However, the converse is\\nnot true. You don’t necessarily need a stationary price series in order\\nto have a successful mean-reverting strategy. Even a nonstationary\\nprice series can have many short-term reversal opportunities that\\none can exploit, as many traders have discovered.\\nMany pair traders are unfamiliar with the concepts of station-\\narity and cointegration. But most of them are familiar withcorrela-\\ntion, which superﬁcially seems to mean the same thing as cointe-\\ngration. Actually, they are quite different. Correlation between two\\nprice series actually refers to the correlations of their returns over\\nsome time horizon (for concreteness, let’s say a day). If two stocks\\nare positively correlated, there is a good chance that their prices\\nwill move in the same direction most days. However, having a posi-\\ntive correlation does not say anything about the long-term behavior\\nof the two stocks. In particular, it doesn’t guarantee that the stock\\nprices will not grow farther and farther apart in the long run even\\nif they do move in the same direction most days. However, if two\\nstocks were cointegrated and remain so in the future, their prices\\n(weighted appropriately) will be unlikely to diverge. Yet their daily\\n(or weekly, or any other time horizon) returns may be quite uncor-\\nrelated.\\nAs an artiﬁcial example of two stocks, A and B, that are coin-\\ntegrated but not correlated, see Figure 7.6. Stock B clearly doesn’t\\nmove in any correlated fashion with stock A: Some days they move\\nin the same direction, other days the opposite. Most days, stock B\\ndoesn’t move at all. But notice that the spread in stock prices be-\\ntween A and B always returns to about $1 after a while.\\nCan we ﬁnd real-life example of this phenomenon? Well, KO\\nversus PEP is one. In the program example7 3.m I have shown\\nthat they do not cointegrate. If, however, you test their daily re-\\nturns for correlation, you will ﬁnd that their correlation of 0.4849\\nis indeed statistically signiﬁcant. The correlation test is presented\\nat the end of the example7 3.m program and shown here in\\nExample 7.3.'),\n",

(Every one of these quantities is time dependent,\\nbut I suppress this explicit dependence for simplicity.)\\nThe terms factor exposure, factor return,a n dspeciﬁc return\\nare commonly used in quantitative ﬁnance, and it is well worth our\\neffort to understand their meanings. Factor returns are the com-\\nmon drivers of stock returns, and are therefore independent of a\\nparticular stock. Factor exposures are the sensitivities to each of\\nthese common drivers. Any part of a stock’s return that cannot be\\nexplained by these common factor returns is deemed a speciﬁc re-\\nturn (i.e., speciﬁc to a stock and essentially regarded as just random\\nnoise within the APT framework). Each stock’s speciﬁc return is as-\\nsumed to be uncorrelated to another stock’s.\\nLet’s illustrate these using a simple factor model called the\\nFama-French Three-Factor model (Fama and French, 1992). This\\nmodel postulates that the excess return of a stock depends linearly\\non only three factor exposures: its beta (i.e., its sensitivity to the\\nmarket index), its market capitalization, and its book-to-price ratio.\\nThese factor exposures are obviously different for each stock and\\nfor each time period. (Factor exposures are often normalized such\\nthat the average of the factor exposures within a universe of stocks\\nis zero, and the standard deviation is 1.)\\nNow that we know how to calculate the factor exposures, what\\nabout the factor returns and speciﬁc returns? We cannot directly\\ncompute the factor returns and speciﬁc returns—we have to infer\\ntheir values by running a multivariate linear regression of the excess\\nreturns of stocks against the factor exposures. Note that each stock\\nrepresents one data point in this linear regression, and we have to\\neither run a separate linear regression for each time period or, if\\nwe want an average value over many time periods, aggregate the\\nvalues from all these time periods into one training set and run one\\nregression against them all.\\nIf you perform this linear regression ﬁt over many time peri-\\nods for the Fama-French Three-Factor model, you will ﬁnd that\\nthe market capitalization factor return is usually negative (meaning'),\n",

And since most stocks\\nare positively correlated with the market index, the beta factor re-\\nturn is positive as well.\\nThe Fama-French model has no monopoly on the choice of\\nfactors. In fact, you can construct as many factors as creativity\\nand rationality allow. For example, you can choose return on eq-\\nuity as a factor exposure, or the correlation of the stock return\\nwith the prime rate as another. You can choose any number of\\nother economic, fundamental, or technical factors. Whether the\\nfactor exposures you have chosen are sensible or not will deter-\\nmine whether the factor model explains the excess returns of the\\nstocks adequately. If the factor exposures (and consequently the\\nmodel as a whole) are poorly chosen, the linear regression ﬁt will\\nproduce speciﬁc returns of signiﬁcant sizes, and the R2 statistic\\nof the ﬁt will be small. According to experts (Grinold and Kahn,\\n1999), the R2 statistic of a good factor model with monthly re-\\nturns of 1,000 stocks and 50 factors is typically about 30 percent to\\n40 percent.\\nIt may appear that these factor models are only explanatory in\\nretrospect—that is, given historical returns and factor exposures,\\nwe can compute the factor returns of those historical periods. But\\nwhat good are those historical factor returns for our trading? It turns\\nout that often factor returns are more stable than individual stock\\nreturns. In other words, they havemomentum. You can therefore\\nassume that their values remain unchanged from the current period\\n(known from the regression ﬁt) to the next time period. If this is\\nthe case, then, of course, you can also predict the excess returns,\\nas long as the factor exposures are well chosen and therefore the\\ntime-varying speciﬁc returns are not signiﬁcant.\\nLet me clarify one point of potential confusion.

To obtain historical values of these factor\\nexposures for a large portfolio of stocks so as to backtest a factor model\\nis usually quite expensive and not very practical to an independent trader.\\n(For those who are ﬁscally prepared to purchase such data, see the list in\\nthe main text.) However, there is one kind of factor model that relies on\\nnothing more than historical returns to construct. This method is the so-\\ncalled principal component analysis (PCA).\\nIf we use PCA to construct the factor exposures and factor returns, we\\nmust assume that the factor exposures are constant (time independent)\\nover the estimation period. (This rules out factors that represent mean re-\\nversion or momentum, since these factor exposures depend on the prior\\nperiod returns.) More importantly, we assume that the factor returns are\\nuncorrelated; that is to say, their covariance matrix ⟨bbT ⟩ is diagonal. If we\\nuse the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix ⟨RR T ⟩ as the columns of the\\nmatrix X in the APT equationR = Xb + u above, we will ﬁnd via elementary\\nlinear algebra that ⟨bbT ⟩ is indeed diagonal; and furthermore, the eigenval-\\nues of ⟨RR T ⟩are none other than the variances of the factor returns b. But\\nof course, there is no point to use factor analysis if the number of factors\\nis the same as the number of stocks—typically, we can just pick the eigen-\\nvectors with the top few eigenvalues to form the matrix X. The number of\\neigenvectors to pick is a parameter that you can adjust to optimize your\\ntrading model.'),\n",

They\\nare based on one of these:\\nr A ﬁxed holding period\\nr A target price or proﬁt cap\\nr The latest entry signals\\nr As t o pp r i c e\\nA ﬁxed holding period is the default exit strategy for any trad-\\ning strategy, whether it is a momentum model, a reversal model, or\\nsome kind of seasonal trading strategy, which can be either momen-\\ntum or reversal based. (More on this later.) I said before that one of\\nthe ways momentum is generated is the slow diffusion of informa-\\ntion. In this case, the process has a ﬁnite lifetime. The average value\\nof this ﬁnite lifetime determines the optimal holding period, which\\ncan usually be discovered in a backtest.\\nOne word of caution on determining the optimal holding period\\nof a momentum model: As I said before, this optimal period typically\\ndecreases due to the increasing speed of the diffusion of information\\nand the increasing number of traders who catch on to this trading\\nopportunity. Hence, a momentum model that has worked well with a\\nholding period equal to a week in the backtest period may work only\\nwith a one-day holding period now. Worse, the whole strategy may\\nbecome unproﬁtable a year into the future. Also, using a backtest of\\nthe trading strategy to determine holding period can be fraught with\\ndata-snooping bias, since the number of historical trades may be\\nlimited. Unfortunately, for a momentum strategy where the trades\\nare triggered by news or events, there are no other alternatives. For\\na mean-reverting strategy, however, there is a more statistically ro-\\nbust way to determine the optimal holding period that does not de-\\npend on the limited number of actual trades.\\nThe mean reversion of a time series can be modeled by an\\nequation called the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck formula (Unlenbeck, 1930).\\nLet’s say we denote the mean-reverting spread (long market value'),\n",

There are actually many versions of this trade. One ver-\\nsion states that small-cap stocks that had the worst returns in the\\nprevious calendar year will have higher returns in January than\\nsmall-cap stocks that had the best returns (Singal, 2006).

As usual, one way to\\nalleviate this problem is to try somewhat different entry and exit\\ndates to see if the proﬁtability holds up. In addition, one should\\nconsider only those trades where the seasonality makes some eco-\\nnomic sense. The gasoline and natural gas trades amply satisfy these\\ncriteria.\\nHIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nSTRATEGIES\\nIn general, if a high Sharpe ratio is the goal of your trading strategy\\n(as it should be, given what I said in Chapter 6), then you should be\\ntrading at high frequencies, rather than holding stocks overnight.\\nWhat are high-frequency trading strategies, and why do they\\nhave superior Sharpe ratios? Many experts in high-frequency trading\\nwould not regard any strategy that holds positions for more than a\\nfew seconds as high frequency, but here I would take a more pedes-\\ntrian approach and include any strategy that does not hold a po-\\nsition overnight. Many of the early high-frequency strategies were\\napplied to the foreign exchange market, and then later on to the fu-\\ntures market, because of their abundance of liquidity. In the last six\\nor seven years, however, with the increasing liquidity in the equity\\nmarket, the availability of historical tick database for stocks, and\\nmushrooming computing power, this type of strategies has become\\nwidespread for stock trading as well.\\nThe reason why these strategies have Sharpe ratio is simple:\\nBased on the “law of large numbers,” the more bets you can place,\\nthe smaller the percent deviation from the mean return you will\\nexperience. With high-frequency trading, one can potentially place\\nhundreds if not thousands of bets all in one day. Therefore, pro-\\nvided the strategy is sound and generates positive mean return, you\\ncan expect the day-to-day deviation from this return to be minimal.\\nWith this high Sharpe ratio, one can increase the leverage to a much'),\n",

In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-\\nfrequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such\\nstrategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-\\nverting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral\\npair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-\\neral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in\\nthe market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.\\nUnlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals\\nwhere the market environment can experience upheavals during the\\nlifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist\\nday to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-\\nmore, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-\\nest sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for\\nhigh-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done\\nvery quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-\\ning and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The\\nworst that can happen as these strategies become more popular is a\\nslow death as a result of gradually diminishing returns. Sudden dras-\\ntic losses are not likely, nor are contagious losses across multiple\\naccounts.\\nThough successful high-frequency strategies have such numer-\\nous merits, it is not easy to backtest such strategies when the\\naverage holding period decreases to minutes or even seconds.\\nTransaction costs are of paramount importance in testing such\\nstrategies. Without incorporating transactions, the simplest strate-\\ngies may seem to work at high frequencies. As a consequence, just\\nhaving high-frequency data with last prices is not sufﬁcient—data\\nwith bid, ask, and last quotes is needed to ﬁnd out the proﬁtability\\nof executing on the bid versus the ask.

High-speed execution may account for a large part of the ac-\\ntual proﬁts or losses. Professional high-frequency trading ﬁrms have\\nbeen writing their strategies in C instead of other, more user-friendly\\nlanguages, and locating their servers next to the exchange or a ma-\\njor Internet backbone to reduce the microsecond delays. So even\\nthough the Sharpe ratio is appealing and the returns astronomical,\\ntruly high-frequency trading is not by any means easy for an inde-\\npendent trader to achieve in the beginning. But there is no reason\\nnot to work toward this goal gradually as expertise and resources\\naccrue.\\nIS IT BETTER TO HAVE\\nA HIGH-LEVERAGE VERSUS\\nAH I G H - B E T AP O R T F O L I O ?\\nIn Chapter 6, I discussed the optimal leverage to apply to a port-\\nfolio based on the Kelly formula. In the section on factor models\\nearlier in this chapter, I discussed the Fama-French Three-Factor\\nmodel, which suggests that return of a portfolio (or a stock) is\\nproportional to its beta (if we hold the market capitalization and\\nbook value of its stocks ﬁxed). In other words, you can increase\\nreturn on a portfolio by either increasing its leverage or increas-\\ning its beta (by selecting high-beta stocks.) Both ways seem com-\\nmonsensical. In fact, it is clear that given a low-beta portfolio and\\na high-beta portfolio, it is easy to apply a higher leverage on the\\nlow-beta portfolio so as to increase its beta to match that of the\\nhigh-beta portfolio. And assuming that the stocks of two portfo-\\nlios have the same average market capitalizations and book val-\\nues, the average returns of the two will also be the same (ignor-\\ning speciﬁc returns, which will decrease in importance as long as\\nwe increase the number stocks in the portfolios), according to the\\nFama-French model. So should we be indifferent to which portfolio\\nto own?\\nThe answer is no. Recall in Chapter 6 that the long-term com-\\npounded growth rate of a portfolio, if we use the Kelly leverage,'),\n",

So if the two hypothetical portfolios have the same average\\nreturn, then we would prefer the one that has the smaller risk or\\nstandard deviation. Empirical studies have found that a portfolio\\nthat consists of low-beta stocks generally has lower risk and thus\\na higher Sharpe ratio.\\nFor example, in a paper titled “Risk Parity Portfolios” (not pub-\\nlicly distributed), Dr. Edward Qian at PanAgora Asset Management\\nargued that a typical 60–40 asset allocation between stocks and\\nbonds is not optimal because it is overweighted with risky assets\\n(stocks in this case). Instead, to achieve a higher Sharpe ratio while\\nmaintaining the same risk level as the 60–40 portfolio, Dr. Qian rec-\\nommended a 23–77 allocation while leveraging the entire portfolio\\nby 1.8.\\nSomehow, the market is chronically underpricing high-beta\\nstocks. Hence, given a choice between a portfolio of high-beta\\nstocks and a portfolio of low-beta stocks, we should prefer the low-\\nbeta one, which we can then leverage up to achieve the maximum\\ncompounded growth rate.\\nThere is one usual caveat, however. All this is based on the Gaus-\\nsian assumption of return distributions. (See discussions in Chapter\\n6 on this issue.) Since the actual returns distributions have fat tails,\\none should be quite wary of using too much leverage on normally\\nlow-beta stocks.\\nSUMMARY\\nThis book has been largely about a particular type of quantitative\\ntrading called statistical arbitrage in the investment industry. De-\\nspite this fancy name, statistical arbitrage is actually far simpler\\nthan trading derivatives (e.g., options) or ﬁxed-income instruments,\\nboth conceptually and mathematically. I have described a large part\\nof the statistical arbitrageur’s standard arsenal: mean reversion and\\nmomentum, regime switching, stationarity and cointegration, arbi-\\ntrage pricing theory or factor model, seasonal trading models, and,\\nﬁnally, high-frequency trading.'),\n",

I ﬁgured that if I could not trade proﬁtably when I was free of\\nall institutional constraints and politics, then either trading is a hoax\\nor I am just not cut out to be a trader. Either way, I promised myself\\nthat in such an event I would quit trading forever. Fortunately, I sur-\\nvived. Along the way, I also found the key to that central mystery to\\nwhich I alluded earlier.\\nThe key, it turns out, iscapacity, a concept I introduced at the\\nend of Chapter 2. (To recap: Capacity is the amount of equity a strat-\\negy can generate good returns on.) It is far, far easier to generate\\na high Sharpe ratio trading a $100,000 account than a $100 million\\naccount. There are many simple and proﬁtable strategies that can\\nwork at the low capacity end that would be totally unsuitable to\\nhedge funds. This is the niche for independent traders like us.\\nLet me elaborate on this capacity issue. Most proﬁtable strate-\\ngies that have low capacities are acting as market makers: provid-\\ning short-term liquidity when it is needed and taking quick proﬁts\\nwhen the liquidity need disappears. If, however, you have billions\\nof dollars to manage, you now become the party in need of liquid-\\nity, and you have to pay for it. To minimize the cost of this liquidity\\ndemand, you necessarily have to hold your positions over long pe-\\nriods of time. When you hold for long periods, your portfolio will\\nbe subject to macroeconomic changes (i.e., regime shifts) that can\\ncause great damage to your portfolio. Though you may still be prof-\\nitable in the long run if your models are sound, you cannot avoid the\\noccasional sharp drawdowns that attract newspaper headlines.\\nOther disadvantages beset large-capacity strategies favored by\\nlarge institutions. The intense competition among hedge funds\\nmeans the strategies become less proﬁtable. The lowered returns\\nin turn pressure the fund manager to overleverage. To beat out the\\ncompetition, traders need to resort to more and more complicated\\nmodels, which in turn invite data-snooping bias. But despite the in-\\ncreasing complexity of the models, the fundamental market inefﬁ-\\nciency that they are trying to exploit may remain the same, and thus\\ntheir portfolios may still end up holding very similar positions. We\\ndiscussed this phenomenon in Chapter 6. When market environment'),\n",

For example, as a trader in a\\nquantitative fund, you may be prohibited from trading a long-only\\nstrategy, but long-only strategies are often easier to ﬁnd, simpler,\\nmore proﬁtable, and if traded in small sizes, no more risky than\\nmarket-neutral strategies. Or you may be prohibited from trading\\nfutures. You may be required to be not only market neutral but\\nalso sector neutral. You may be asked to ﬁnd a momentum strat-\\negy when you know that a mean-reverting strategy would work.\\nAnd on and on. Many of these constraints are imposed for risk\\nmanagement reasons, but many others may be just whims, quirks,\\nand prejudices of the management. As every student of mathe-\\nmatical optimization knows, any constraint imposed on an opti-\\nmization problem decreases the optimal objective value. Similarly,\\nevery institutional constraint imposed on a trading strategy tends to\\ndecrease its returns, if not its Sharpe ratio as well. Finally, some\\nsenior managers who oversee frontline portfolio managers of quan-\\ntitative funds are actually not well versed in quantitative techniques,\\nand they tend to make decisions based on anything but quantitative\\ntheories.\\nWhen your strategy shows initial proﬁts, these managers may\\nimpose enormous pressure for you to scale up quickly, and when\\nyour strategy starts to lose, they may force you to liquidate the port-\\nfolios and abandon the strategy immediately. None of these inter-\\nferences in the quantitative investment process is mathematically\\noptimal.\\nBesides, such managers often have a mercurial temper, which\\nseldom mixes well with quantitative investment management. When\\nloss of money occurs, rationality is often the ﬁrst victim.\\nAs an independent trader, you are free from such constraints\\nand interferences, and as long as you are emotionally capable to\\nadhere to the discipline of quantitative trading, your trading envi-\\nronment may actually be closer to the optimal than that of a large\\nfund.'),\n",

Where do you go from here?\\nHow do yougrow?\\nActually, I discussed growth in Chapter 6, but in a limited sense.\\nUsing the Kelly formula, you can indeed achieve exponential growth\\nof your equity, but only up to the total capacity of your strategies. Af-\\nter that, the source of growth has to come from increasing the num-\\nber of strategies. You can, for example, look for strategies that trade\\nat higher frequencies than the ones you currently have. To do that,\\nyou have to invest and upgrade your technological infrastructure,\\nand purchase expensive high-frequency historical data. Or, con-\\nversely, you can look for strategies that hold longer periods. Despite\\ntheir typically lower Sharpe ratios, they do enormously improve\\nyour capacity. For many of these strategies, you probably have to\\ninvest in expensive historical fundamental data for your backtest.\\nIf you are an equity trader, you can branch out into futures or\\ncurrencies, which typically have higher capacities than equity mod-\\nels. If you run out of ideas or lack expertise in a new market that you\\nwant to enter, you can form collaborations with other like-minded\\ntraders, or you can hire consultants to help with the research. If you\\nare running too many strategies to manage manually on your own,\\nyou can push your automation further so that there is no need for\\nyou to manually intervene in the daily trading unless exceptions or\\nproblems occur. Of course, you can also hire a trader to monitor all\\nthese strategies for you.\\nThese investments in data, infrastructure, and personnel are all\\npart of reinvesting some of your earnings to further the growth of\\nyour trading business, not unlike growing any other type of busi-\\nness.

Once you have\\nautomated everything and your equity is growing exponentially, can\\nyou just sit back, relax, and enjoy your wealth? Unfortunately, ex-\\nperience tells us that strategies do lose their potency over time as\\nmore traders catch on to them. It takes ongoing research to supply\\nyou with new strategies.\\nThere are always upheavals and major regime changes that may\\noccur once every decade but will nevertheless cause sudden deaths\\nto certain strategies. As with any commercial endeavor, a period of\\nrapid growth will inevitably be followed by the steady if unspectac-\\nular returns of a mature business.

(Many of\\nthe ﬁgures and charts in this book are created using MATLAB.) Fi-\\nnally, MATLAB codes can be compiled into C or C++ executables\\nthat can run on computers without the MATLAB platform installed.\\nIn fact, there is third-party software that can convert MATLAB code\\ninto C source codes, too.\\nThe basic syntax of MATLAB is very similar to Visual Basic or C.\\nFor example, we can initialize the elements of an array x like this:\\nx(1)=0.1;\\nx(2)=0.3;\\n% 3 elements of an array initialized.\\n% This is by default a row-vector\\nx(3)=0.2;\\nNote that we don’t need to ﬁrst “declare” this array, nor do we\\nneed to tell MATLAB its expected size beforehand. If you leave out\\nthe “;” sign, MATLAB will print out the result of the content of the\\nvariable being assigned a value. Any comments can be written after\\nthe “%” sign. If you wish, you can initialize a large number of ele-\\nments en masse to a common value:\\n% assigning the value 0.8 to all elements of a 3-vector y.\\nThis is a row-vector.y=0.8*ones(1, 3)\\nNow if you want to do a vector addition of the two vectors, you\\ncan do it the old-fashioned way (just as you would in C), that is,\\nusing a loop:\\nfor i=1:3\\nz(i)=x(i)+y(i) % z is [0.9 1.1 1]\\nend\\nBut the power of MATLAB is that it can handle many array oper-\\nations in parallel very succinctly, without using loops.

In this honest and practical guide, Dr. Chan \\nhighlights the essential cornerstones of a successful automated trading operation and shares lessons he \\nlearned the hard way while offering clear direction to steer readers away from common traps that both \\nindividual and institutional traders often succumb to.”\\n— ROSARIO M. INGARGIOLA, CTO, Alphacet, Inc.\\n“This book provides valuable insight into how private investors can establish a solid structure for success \\ni\\nn algorithmic trading.

In most instances, the authors have no real knowledge of the subject matter, or do \\nhave something important to say but are unwilling to do so because of fears of having trade secrets stolen. \\nErnie subscribes to a different credo: Share meaningful information and have meaningful interactions \\nwith the quantitative community at large. Ernie successfully distills a large amount of detailed and difﬁ cult \\nsubject matter down to a very clear and comprehensive resource for novice and pro alike.”\\n— STEVE HALPERN, founder, HCC Capital, LLC\\nWiley Trading\\nERNEST P.

There are, of course, innumerable books on the ad-\\nvanced mathematics and strategies utilized by institutional traders\\nin this arena. However, can an independent, retail trader beneﬁt\\nfrom these algorithms? Can an individual with limited resources and\\ncomputing power backtest and execute their strategies over thou-\\nsands of stocks, and come to challenge the powerful industry par-\\nticipants in their own game?\\nI will show you how this can, in fact, be achieved.\\nWHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?\\nI wrote this book with two types of readers in mind:\\n1. Aspiring independent (“retail”) traders who are looking to start\\na quantitative trading business.\\n2. Students of ﬁnance or other technical disciplines (at the un-\\ndergraduate or MBA level) who aspire to become quantitative\\ntraders and portfolio managers at major institutions.\\nCan these two very different groups of readers beneﬁt from the\\nsame set of knowledge and skills? Is there anything common be-\\ntween managing a $100 million portfolio and managing a $100,000\\nportfolio? My contention is that it is much more logical and sen-\\nsible for someone to become a proﬁtable $100,000 trader before\\nxi'),\n",

They did\\nnot begin as portfolio managers for investment banks and hedge\\nfunds before starting their own fund management business. Of\\ncourse, there are also plenty of counterexamples, but clearly this\\nis a possible route to riches as well as intellectual accomplishment,\\nand for someone with an entrepreneurial bent, a preferred route.\\nEven if your goal is to become an institutional trader, it is still\\nworthwhile to start your own trading business as a ﬁrst step. Physi-\\ncists and mathematicians are now swarming Wall Street. Few peo-\\nple on the Street are impressed by a mere PhD from a prestigious\\nuniversity anymore. What is the surest way to get through the door\\nof the top banks and funds? To show that you have a systematic\\nway to proﬁts—in other words, a track record. Quite apart from\\nserving as a stepping stone to a lucrative career in big institutions,\\nhaving a proﬁtable track record as an independent trader is an in-\\nvaluable experience in itself. The experience forces you to focus on\\nsimple but proﬁtable strategies, and not get sidetracked by overly\\ntheoretical or sophisticated theories. It also forces you to focus\\non the nitty-gritty of quantitative trading that you won’t learn from\\nmost books: things such as how to build an order entry system that\\ndoesn’t cost $10,000 of programming resource. Most importantly, it\\nforces you to focus on risk management—after all, your own per-\\nsonal bankruptcy is a possibility here. Finally, having been an insti-\\ntutional as well as a retail quantitative trader and strategist at differ-\\nent times, I only wish that I had read a similar book before I started\\nmy career at a bank—I would have achieved proﬁtability many\\nyears sooner.\\nGiven these preambles, I won’t make any further apologies in\\nthe rest of the book in focusing on the entrepreneurial, indepen-\\ndent traders and how they can build a quantitative trading business\\non their own, while hoping that many of the lessons would be useful\\non their way to institutional money management as well.'),\n",

Yes, you do need to possess some basic knowledge\\nof statistics, such as how to calculate averages, standard deviations,\\nor how to ﬁt a straight line through a set of data points. Yes, you\\nalso need to have some basic familiarity with Excel. But what you\\ndon’t need is any advanced knowledge of stochastic calculus, neural\\nnetworks, or other impressive-sounding techniques.\\nThough it is true that you can make millions with nothing more\\nthan Excel, it is also true that there is another tool that, if you are\\nproﬁcient at it, will enable you to backtest trading strategies much\\nmore efﬁciently, and may also allow you to retrieve and process\\ndata much more easily than you otherwise can. This tool is called\\nMATLAB®, and it is a mathematical platform that many institutional\\nquantitative strategists and portfolio managers use. Therefore, I will\\ndemonstrate how to backtest the majority of strategies using MAT-\\nLAB. In fact, I have included a brief tutorial in the appendix on how\\nto do some basic programming in MATLAB. For many retail traders,\\nMATLAB is too expensive to purchase, but there are cheaper alter-\\nnatives, which I will mention in Chapter 3 on backtesting. Further-\\nmore, many university students can either purchase a cheaper stu-\\ndent MATLAB license or they already have free access to it through\\ntheir schools.\\nWHAT WILL YOU FIND IN THIS BOOK?\\nThis book is deﬁnitely not designed as an encyclopedia of quantita-\\ntive trading techniques or terminologies. It will not even be about\\nspeciﬁc proﬁtable strategies (although you can reﬁne the few ex-\\nample strategies embedded here to make them quite proﬁtable.) In-\\nstead, this is a book that teaches you how to ﬁnd a proﬁtable strategy\\nyourself. It teaches you the characteristics of a good strategy, how\\nto reﬁne and backtest a strategy to ensure that it has good historical\\nperformance, and, more importantly, to ensure that it will remain'),\n",

Finally, it teaches you\\nsome basics of risk management, which is critical if you want to sur-\\nvive over the long term, and also some psychological pitfalls to avoid\\nif you want an enjoyable (and not just proﬁtable) life as a trader.\\nEven though the basic techniques for ﬁnding a good strategy\\nshould work for any tradable securities, I have focused my ex-\\namples on an area of trading I personally know best: statistical\\narbitrage trading in stocks. While I discuss sources of historical\\ndata on stocks, futures, and foreign currencies in the chapter on\\nbacktesting, I did not include options because those are not in my\\narea of expertise.\\nThe book is organized roughly in the order of the steps that\\ntraders need to undertake to set up their quantitative trading busi-\\nness. These steps begin at ﬁnding a viable trading strategy (Chap-\\nter 2), then backtesting the strategy to ensure that it at least has\\ngood historical performance (Chapter 3), setting up the business\\nand technological infrastructure (Chapter 4), building an automated\\ntrading system to execute your strategy (Chapter 5), and managing\\nthe money and risks involved in holding positions generated by this\\nstrategy (Chapter 6). I will then describe in Chapter 7 a number of\\nimportant advanced concepts with which most professional quan-\\ntitative traders are familiar, and ﬁnally conclude in Chapter 8 with\\nreﬂections on how independent traders can ﬁnd their niche and how\\nthey can grow their business. I have also included an appendix that\\ncontains a tutorial on using MATLAB.\\nYou’ll see two different types of boxed material in this book:\\nr Sidebars containing an elaboration or illustration of a concept, and\\nr Examples, accompanied by MATLAB or Excel code.'),\n",

But even for readers who\\nlearned about this kind of trading from the mainstream media\\nbefore, it is worth clearing up some common misconceptions.\\nQuantitative trading, also known as algorithmic trading, is the\\ntrading of securities based strictly on the buy/sell decisions of com-\\nputer algorithms. The computer algorithms are designed and per-\\nhaps programmed by the traders themselves, based on the histor-\\nical performance of the encoded strategy tested against historical\\nﬁnancial data.\\nIs quantitative trading just a fancy name for technical analysis,\\nthen? Granted, a strategy based on technical analysis can be part of\\na quantitative trading system if it can be fully encoded as computer\\nprograms. However, not all technical analysis can be regarded as\\nquantitative trading. For example, certain chartist techniques such\\nas “look for the formation of a head and shoulders pattern” might\\nnot be included in a quantitative trader’s arsenal because they are\\nquite subjective and may not be quantiﬁable.\\nYet quantitative trading includes more than just technical anal-\\nysis. Many quantitative trading systems incorporate fundamental\\ndata in their inputs: numbers such as revenue, cash ﬂow, debt-to-\\nequity ratio, and others.

When it comes to judging the current ﬁnancial per-\\nformance of a company compared to its peers or compared to its\\nhistorical performance, the computer is often just as good as hu-\\nman ﬁnancial analysts—and the computer can watch thousands of\\nsuch companies all at once. Some advanced quantitative systems\\ncan even incorporate news events as inputs: Nowadays, it is pos-\\nsible to use a computer to parse and understand the news report.\\n(After all, I used to be a researcher in this very ﬁeld at IBM, work-\\ning on computer systems that can understand approximately what a\\ndocument is about.)\\nSo you get the picture: As long as you can convert information\\ninto bits and bytes that the computer can understand, it can be re-\\ngarded as part of quantitative trading.\\nWHO CAN BECOME A\\nQUANTITATIVE TRADER?\\nIt is true that most institutional quantitative traders received their\\nadvanced degrees as physicists, mathematicians, engineers, or com-\\nputer scientists. This kind of training in the hard sciences is often\\nnecessary when you want to analyze or trade complex derivative\\ninstruments. But those instruments are not the focus in this book.\\nThere is no law stating that one can become wealthy only by work-\\ning with complicated ﬁnancial instruments. (In fact, one can become\\nquite poor trading complex mortgage-backed securities, as the ﬁnan-\\ncial crisis of 2007–08 and the demise of Bear Stearns have shown.)\\nThe kind of quantitative trading I focus on is calledstatistical ar-\\nbitrage trading.Statistical arbitrage deals with the simplest ﬁnan-\\ncial instruments: stocks, futures, and sometimes currencies. One\\ndoes not need an advanced degree to become a statistical arbitrage\\ntrader.

When one\\nplunges into independent trading, fear of losses and of being iso-\\nlated from the rest of the world is natural, and so it helps to have\\nboth a prior appreciation of risks and some savings to lean on. It is\\nimportant not to have a need for immediate proﬁts to sustain your\\ndaily living, as strategies have intrinsic rates of returns that cannot\\nbe hurried (see Chapter 6).\\nInstead of fear, some of you are planning to trade because of\\nthe love of thrill and danger, or an incredible self-conﬁdence that\\ninstant wealth is imminent. This is also a dangerous emotion to bring\\nto independent quantitative trading. As I hope to persuade you in\\nthis chapter and in the rest of the book, instant wealth is not the\\nobjective of quantitative trading.\\nThe ideal independent quantitative trader is therefore someone\\nwho has some prior experience with ﬁnance or computer program-\\nming, who has enough savings to withstand the inevitable losses and\\nperiods without income, and whose emotion has found the right bal-\\nance between fear and greed.\\nTHE BUSINESS CASE FOR\\nQUANTITATIVE TRADING\\nA lot of us are in the business of quantitative trading because it is\\nexciting, intellectually stimulating, ﬁnancially rewarding, or perhaps\\nit is the only thing we are good at doing. But for others who may have\\nalternative skills and opportunities, it is worth pondering whether\\nquantitative trading is the best business for you.\\nDespite all the talk about untold hedge fund riches and dollars\\nthat are measured in units of billions, in many ways starting a\\nquantitative trading business is very similar to starting any small\\nbusiness. We need to start small, with limited investment (perhaps'),\n",

Here are some of the most\\nimportant.\\nScalability\\nCompared to most small businesses (other than certain dot-coms),\\nquantitative trading is very scalable (up to a point). It is easy to ﬁnd\\nyourselves trading millions of dollars in the comfort of your own\\nhome, as long as your strategy is consistently proﬁtable. This is be-\\ncause scaling up often just means changing a number in your pro-\\ngram. This number is calledleverage. You do not need to negotiate\\nwith a banker or a venture capitalist to borrow more capital for your\\nbusiness. The brokerages stand ready and willing to do that. If you\\nare a member of a proprietary trading ﬁrm (more on this later in\\nChapter 4 on setting up a business), you may even be able to obtain\\na leverage far exceeding that allowed by Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (SEC) Regulation T. It is not unheard of for a propri-\\netary trading ﬁrm to let you trade a portfolio worth $2 million in-\\ntraday even if you have only $50,000 equity in your account (a×40\\nleverage). At the same time, quantitative trading is deﬁnitely not a\\nget-rich-quick scheme. You should hope to have steadily increasing\\nproﬁts, but most likely it won’t be 200 percent a year, unlike starting\\na dot-com or a software ﬁrm. In fact, as I will explain in Chapter 6\\non money and risk management, it is dangerous to overleverage in\\npursuit of overnight riches.\\nDemand on Time\\nRunning most small businesses takes a lot of your time, at least\\ninitially. Quantitative trading takes relatively little of your time. By\\nits very nature, quantitative trading is a highly automated business.\\nSometimes, the more you manually interfere with the system and\\noverride its decision, the worse it will perform.

How do you recognize a good versus a bad strat-\\negy even before devoting any time to backtesting them? How do you\\nrigorously backtest them? If the backtest performance is good, what\\nsteps do you need to take to implement the strategy, in terms of both\\nthe business structure and the technological infrastructure? If the\\nstrategy is proﬁtable in initial real-life trading, how does one scale\\nup the capital to make it into a growing income stream while manag-\\ning the inevitable (but, hopefully, only occasional) losses that come\\nwith trading? These nuts and bolts of quantitative trading will be\\ntackled in Chapters 2 through 6.\\nThough the list of processes to go through in order to get to the\\nﬁnal destination of sustained and growing proﬁtability may seem\\nlong and daunting, in reality it may be faster and easier than many\\nother businesses. When I ﬁrst started as an independent trader, it\\ntook me only three months to ﬁnd and backtest my ﬁrst new strat-\\negy, set up a new brokerage account with $100,000 capital, imple-\\nment the execution system, and start trading the strategy. The strat-\\negy immediately became proﬁtable in the ﬁrst month. Back in the\\ndot-com era, I started an Internet software ﬁrm. It took about 3 times\\nmore investment, 5 times more human-power, and 24 times longer\\nto ﬁnd out that the business model didn’t work, whereupon all in-\\nvestors including myself lost 100 percent of their investments. Com-\\npared to that experience, it really has been a breeze trading quanti-\\ntatively and proﬁtably.'),\n",

Just like the academic studies, the strategies from\\ntraders’ forums may have worked only for a little while, or they\\nwork for only a certain class of stocks, or they work only if you\\ndon’t factor in transaction costs. However, the trick is that you\\ncan often modify the basic strategy and make it proﬁtable. (Many\\nof these caveats as well as a few common variations on a basic\\nstrategy will be examined in detail in Chapter 3.)\\nFor example, someone once suggested a strategy to me that was\\ndescribed in Wealth-Lab (see Table 2.1), where it was claimed that it\\nhad a high Sharpe ratio. When I backtested the strategy, it turned out\\nnot to work as well as advertised. I then tried a few simple modiﬁca-\\ntions, such as decreasing the holding period and entering and exiting\\nat different times than suggested, and was able to turn this strategy\\ninto one of my main proﬁt centers.

But then I found\\nout that one of the best ways to gather and share trading ideas is\\nto start your own trading blog—for every trading “secret” that you\\ndivulge to the world, you will be rewarded with multiple ones from\\nyour readers. (The person who suggested the Wealth-Lab strategy to\\nme was a reader who works 12 time zones away. If it weren’t for my\\nblog, there was little chance that I would have met him and bene-\\nﬁted from his suggestion.)

Then, when I\\nﬁrst became independent, my level of automation was still relatively\\nlow, so I considered only strategies that require entering orders once\\nbefore the market opens and once before the close. Later on, I added\\na program that can automatically scan real-time market data and\\ntransmit orders to my brokerage account throughout the trading day\\nwhen certain conditions are met. So trading remains a “part-time”\\npursuit for me, which is partly why I want to trade quantitatively in\\nthe ﬁrst place.\\nYour Programming Skills\\nAre you good at programming? If you know some programming\\nlanguages such as Visual Basic or even Java, C#, or C++, you can\\nexplore high-frequency strategies, and you can also trade a large\\nnumber of securities.

In general, I would not recommend\\nquantitative trading for an account with less than $50,000 capi-\\ntal. Let’s say the dividing line between a high- versus low-capital\\naccount is $100,000. Capital availability affects many choices; the\\nﬁrst is whether you should open a retail brokerage account or a\\nproprietary trading account (more on this in Chapter 4 on setting\\nup your business). For now, I will consider this constraint with\\nstrategy choices in mind.\\nWith a low-capital account, we need to ﬁnd strategies that can\\nutilize the maximum leverage available.

Trading futures, currencies, and options can offer you\\nhigher leverage than stocks; intraday positions allow a Regulation\\nT leverage of 4, while interday (overnight) positions allow only a\\nleverage of 2, requiring double the amount of capital for a portfo-\\nlio of the same size. Finally, capital (or leverage) availability de-\\ntermines whether you should focus on directional trades (long or\\nshort only) or dollar-neutral trades (hedged or pair trades). A dollar-\\nneutral portfolio (meaning the market value of the long positions\\nequals the market value of the short positions) or market-neutral\\nportfolio (meaning thebeta of the portfolio with respect to a mar-\\nket index is close to zero, wherebeta measures the ratio between\\nthe expected returns of the portfolio and the expected returns of\\nthe market index) require twice the capital or leverage of a long- or\\nshort-only portfolio. So even though a hedged position is less risky\\nthan an unhedged position, the returns generated are correspond-\\ningly smaller and may not meet your personal requirements.\\nCapital availability also imposes a number of indirect con-\\nstraints. It affects how much you can spend on various infrastruc-\\nture, data, and software. For example, if you have low trading capi-\\ntal, your online brokerage will not be likely to supply you with real-\\ntime market data for too many stocks, so you can’t really have a\\nstrategy that requires real-time market data over a large universe of\\nstocks. (You can, of course, subscribe to a third-party market data\\nvendor, but then the extra cost may not be justiﬁable if your trad-\\ning capital is low.) Similarly, clean historical stock data with high\\nfrequency costs more than historical daily stock data, so a high-\\nfrequency stock-trading strategy may not be feasible with small cap-\\nital expenditure. For historical stock data, there is another quality\\nthat may be even more important than their frequencies: whether\\nthe data are free of survivorship bias. I will deﬁne survivorship bias\\nin the following section.

The maximum drawdownis the difference\\nbetween the global maximum of the equity curve with the global\\nminimum of the curve after the occurrence of the global maximum\\n(time order matters here: The global minimum must occur later\\nthan the global maximum). The global maximum is called the “high\\nwatermark.” Themaximum drawdown duration is the longest it\\nhas taken for the equity curve to recover losses.\\nMore often, drawdowns are measured in percentage terms, with\\nthe denominator being the equity at the high watermark, and the nu-\\nmerator being the loss of equity since reaching the high watermark.\\nFigure 2.1 illustrates a typical drawdown, the maximum draw-\\ndown, and the maximum drawdown duration of an equity curve.\\nI will include a tutorial in Example 3.5 on how to compute these\\nquantities from a table of daily proﬁts and losses using either Excel\\nor MATLAB. One thing to keep in mind: The maximum drawdown\\nand the maximum drawdown duration do not typically overlap over\\nthe same period.\\nDeﬁned mathematically, drawdown seems abstract and remote.\\nHowever, in real life there is nothing more gut-wrenching and\\nemotionally disturbing to suffer than a drawdown if you’re a trader.\\n(This is as true for independent traders as for institutional ones.\\nWhen an institutional trading group is suffering a drawdown, every-\\nbody seems to feel that life has lost meaning and spend their days'),\n",

It is therefore something we would want to mini-\\nmize. You have to ask yourself, realistically, how deep and how long\\na drawdown will you be able to tolerate and not liquidate your port-\\nfolio and shut down your strategy? Would it be 20 percent and three\\nmonths, or 10 percent and one month? Comparing your tolerance\\nwith the numbers obtained from the backtest of a candidate strat-\\negy determines whether that strategy is for you.\\nEven if the author of the strategy you read about did not pub-\\nlish the precise numbers for drawdowns, you should still be able to\\nmake an estimate from a graph of its equity curve. For example, in\\nFigure 2.1, you can see that the longest drawdown goes from around\\nFebruary 2001 to around October 2002. So the maximum drawdown\\nduration is about 20 months. Also, at the beginning of the maximum\\ndrawdown, the equity was about $2.3× 104, and at the end, about\\n$0.5 × 104. So the maximum drawdown is about $1.8× 104.\\nHow Will Transaction Costs Affect the Strategy?\\nEvery time a strategy buys and sells a security, it incurs a trans-\\naction cost. The more frequent it trades, the larger the impact of\\ntransaction costs will be on the proﬁtability of the strategy. These\\ntransaction costs are not just due to commission fees charged by\\nthe broker. There will also be the cost of liquidity—when you buy\\nand sell securities at their market prices, you are paying the bid-ask\\nspread. If you buy and sell securities using limit orders, however,\\nyou avoid the liquidity costs but incur opportunity costs. This is be-\\ncause your limit orders may not be executed, and therefore you may\\nmiss out on the potential proﬁts of your trade. Also, when you buy\\nor sell a large chunk of securities, you will not be able to complete\\nthe transaction without impacting the prices at which this transac-\\ntion is done. (Sometimes just displaying a bid to buy a large number\\nof shares for a stock can move the prices higher without your having\\nbought a single share yet!) This effect on the market prices due to\\nyour own order is calledmarket impact,and it can contribute to a\\nlarge part of the total transaction cost when the security is not very\\nliquid.'),\n",

This delay can cause a “slippage,” the difference be-\\ntween the price that triggers the order and the execution price. Of\\ncourse, this slippage can be of either sign, but on average it will be\\na cost rather than a gain to the trader. (If you ﬁnd that it is a gain on\\naverage, you should change your program to deliberately delay the\\ntransmission of the order by a few seconds!)\\nTransaction costs vary widely for different kinds of securities.\\nYou can typically estimate it by taking half the average bid-ask\\nspread of a security and then adding the commission if your or-\\nder size is not much bigger than the average sizes of the best bid\\nand offer. If you are trading S&P 500 stocks, for example, the aver-\\nage transaction cost (excluding commissions, which depend on your\\nbrokerage) would be about 5 basis points (that is, ﬁve-hundredths of\\na percent). Note that I count a round-trip transaction of a buy and\\nthen a sell as two transactions—hence, a round trip will cost 10 ba-\\nsis points in this example. If you are trading ES, the E-mini S&P 500\\nfutures, the transaction cost will be about 1 basis point. Sometimes\\nthe authors whose strategies you read about will disclose that they\\nhave included transaction costs in their backtest performance, but\\nmore often they will not. If they haven’t, then you just to have to\\nassume that the results are before transactions, and apply your own\\njudgment to its validity.\\nAs an example of the impact of transaction costs on a strategy,\\nconsider this simple mean-reverting strategy on ES. It is based on\\nBollinger bands: that is, every time the price exceeds plus or minus\\n2 moving standard deviations of its moving average, short or buy, re-\\nspectively. Exit the position when the price reverts back to within 1\\nmoving standard deviation of the moving average. If you allow your-\\nself to enter and exit every ﬁve minutes, you will ﬁnd that the Sharpe\\nratio is about 3 without transaction costs—very excellent indeed!\\nUnfortunately, the Sharpe ratio is reduced to –3 if we subtract 1 ba-\\nsis point as transaction costs, making it a very unproﬁtable strategy.\\nFor another example of the impact of transaction costs, see\\nExample 3.7.'),\n",

(The same term can be applied to mutual fund or hedge\\nfund databases that do not include funds that went out of business.)\\nBacktesting a strategy using data with survivorship bias can be dan-\\ngerous because it may inﬂate the historical performance of the strat-\\negy. This is especially true if the strategy has a “value” bent; that is,\\nit tends to buy stocks that are cheap. Some stocks were cheap be-\\ncause the companies were going bankrupt shortly. So if your strat-\\negy includes only those cases when the stocks were very cheap\\nbut eventually survived (and maybe prospered) and neglects those\\ncases where the stocks ﬁnally did get delisted, the backtest perfor-\\nmance will, of course, be much better than what a trader would ac-\\ntually have suffered at that time.\\nSo when you read about a “buy on the cheap” strategy that has\\ngreat performance, ask the author of that strategy whether it was\\ntested on survivorship bias–free (sometimes called “point-in-time”)\\ndata. If not, be skeptical of its results. (A toy strategy that illustrates\\nthis can be found in Example 3.3.)\\nHow Did the Performance of the Strategy\\nChange over the Years?\\nMost strategies performed much better 10 years ago than now, at\\nleast in a backtest.

Also, bid-ask spreads were much wider\\nthen: So if you assumed the transaction cost today was applicable\\nthroughout the backtest, the earlier period would have unrealisti-\\ncally high returns.\\nSurvivorship bias in the data might also contribute to the good\\nperformance in the early period.

Simple models are often the ones\\nthat will stand the test of time. (See the sidebar on my views on\\nartiﬁcial intelligence and stock picking.)\\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND STOCK\\nPICKING*\\nThere was an article in theNew York Timesa short while ago about a new hedge\\nfund launched by Mr. Ray Kurzweil, a pioneer in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence.\\n(Thanks to my fellow blogger, Yaser Anwar, who pointed it out to me.) According\\nto Kurzweil, the stock-picking decisions in this fund are supposed to be made\\nby machines that “... can observe billions of market transactions to see patterns\\nwe could never see” (quoted in Duhigg, 2006).\\nWhile I am certainly a believer in algorithmic trading, I have become a skep-\\ntic when it comes to trading based on “artiﬁcial intelligence.”\\nAt the risk of oversimpliﬁcation, we can characterize artiﬁcial intelligence\\n(AI) as trying to ﬁt past data points into a function with many, many param-\\neters. This is the case for some of the favorite tools of AI: neural networks,\\ndecision trees, and genetic algorithms. With many parameters, we can for sure\\ncapture small patterns that no human can see. But do these patterns persist?\\nOr are they random noises that will never replay again? Experts in AI assure\\nus that they have many safeguards against ﬁtting the function to transient\\nnoise. And indeed, such tools have been very eﬀective in consumer market-\\ning and credit card fraud detection. Apparently, the patterns of consumers and\\nthefts are quite consistent over time, allowing such AI algorithms to work even\\nwith a large number of parameters. However, from my experience, these safe-\\nguards work far less well in ﬁnancial markets prediction, and overﬁtting to\\nthe noise in historical data remains a rampant problem. As a matter of fact,\\nI have built ﬁnancial predictive models based on many of these AI algorithms in\\nthe past. Every time a carefully constructed model that seems to work marvels\\nin backtest came up, they inevitably performed miserably going forward. The\\nmain reason for this seems to be that the amount of statistically independent\\nﬁnancial data is far more limited compared to the billions of independent con-\\nsumer and credit transactions available. (You may think that there is a lot of tick-\\nby-tick ﬁnancial data to mine, but such data is serially correlated and far from\\nindependent.)'),\n",

But more than just perform-\\ning due diligence, doing the backtest yourself allows you to exper-\\niment with variations of the original strategy, thereby reﬁning and\\nimproving the strategy.\\nIn this chapter, I will describe the common platforms that can\\nbe used for backtesting, various sources of historical data useful for\\nbacktesting, a minimal set of standard performance measures that a\\nbacktest should provide, common pitfalls to avoid, and simple re-\\nﬁnements and improvements to strategies. A few fully developed\\nbacktesting examples will also be presented to illustrate the prin-\\nciples and techniques described.\\n31'),\n",

In\\nkeeping with the focus on start-ups in this book, I start with those\\nwith which I am familiar and that can be purchased economically\\nand are widely used.\\nExcel\\nThis is the most basic and most common tool for traders, whether\\nretail or institutional. You can enhance its power further if you can\\nwrite Visual Basic macros. The beauty of Excel is “What you see\\nis what you get” (or WYSIWYG in computing parlance). Data and\\nprogram are all in one place so that nothing is hidden. Also, a com-\\nmon backtesting pitfall called “look-ahead bias,” which will be ex-\\nplained later, is unlikely to occur in Excel (unless you use macros,\\nwhich renders it no longer WYSIWYG) because you can easily align\\nthe dates with the various data columns and signals on a spread-\\nsheet. Another advantage of Excel is that often backtesting and live\\ntrade generation can be done from the same spreadsheet, eliminat-\\ning any duplication of programming efforts. The major disadvantage\\nof Excel is that it can be used to backtest only fairly simple models.\\nBut, as I explained in the previous chapter, simple models are often\\nthe best!\\nMATLAB\\nMATLAB R⃝ (www.mathworks.com) is one of the most common\\nbacktesting platforms used by quantitative analysts and traders in\\nlarge institutions. It is ideal for testing strategies that involve a\\nlarge portfolio of stocks. (Imagine backtesting a strategy involving\\n1,500 symbols on Excel—it is possible, but quite painful.). It has nu-\\nmerous advanced statistical and mathematical modules built in, so\\ntraders do not have to reinvent the wheel if their trading algorithms\\ninvolve some sophisticated but common mathematical concepts.'),\n",

See Example 7.4.) There\\nis also a large number of third-party freeware available for down-\\nload from the Internet, many of them very useful for quantitative\\ntrading purposes (an example is the cointegration package used in\\nExample 7.2). Finally, MATLAB is very useful in retrieving web\\npages with ﬁnancial information and parsing it into a useful form\\n(so-called web scraping). Example 3.1 shows how this can be done.\\nDespite the seeming sophistication of the platform, it is actually\\nvery easy to learn (at least for basic usage) and it is very quick to\\nwrite a complete backtest program using this language. The main\\ndrawback of MATLAB is that it is relatively expensive: it costs over\\n$1,000 to acquire a license. However, there are several clones of\\nMATLAB on the market where you can write and use codes that\\nare very similar to MATLAB:\\nr O-Matrix (www.omatrix.com)\\nr Octave (www.gnu.org/software/octave)\\nr Scilab (www.scilab.org)\\nThese clones may cost only several hundred dollars, or may be\\nentirely free. Not surprisingly, the more expensive the clone is, the\\nmore compatible it is with programs written in MATLAB. (Of course,\\nif you intend to write all the programs yourself and not use any third\\nparty’s codes, compatibility is not an issue. But then you would be\\nforfeiting one of the main beneﬁts of using this language.) The other\\ndrawback of MATLAB is that it is very useful for backtesting but\\nclumsy to use as an execution platform. So, often, you will need\\nto build a separate execution system in another language once you\\nhave backtested your strategy. Despite these drawbacks, MATLAB\\nhas found widespread use within the quantitative trading commu-\\nnity. I will include MATLAB codes for all the backtesting examples\\nin this book as well as provide a quick survey of the MATLAB lan-\\nguage itself in the appendix.'),\n",

Notice that I adjust the historical prices by a multiplier instead\\nof subtracting $dso that the historical daily returns will remain the\\nsame pre- and postadjustment. This is the way Yahoo! Finance ad-\\njusts its historical data, and is the most common way. (If you adjust\\nby subtracting $dinstead, the historical daily changes in prices will\\nbe the same pre- and postadjustment, but not the daily returns.) If\\nthe historical data are not adjusted, you will ﬁnd a drop in price\\nat the ex-date’s market open from previous day’s close (apart from\\nnormal market ﬂuctuation), which may trigger an erroneous trading\\nsignal.\\nI recommend getting historical data that are already split and\\ndividend adjusted, because otherwise you would have to ﬁnd a\\nseparate historical database (such as earnings.com) of splits and\\ndividends and apply the adjustments yourself—a somewhat te-\\ndious and error-prone task, which I will describe in the following\\nexample.\\nExample 3.2: Adjusting for Splits and Dividends\\nHere we look at IGE, an ETF that has had both splits and dividends in its\\nhistory.

Let’s say from a universe of the 1,000\\nlargest stocks (based on market capitalization), we pick 10 that have the\\nlowest closing prices at the beginning of the year and hold them (with equal\\ninitial capital) for one year.

The NaNs indi-\\ncate those with nonexistent closing prices on 1/2/2002. The Terminal Price\\ncolumn indicates the last prices at which the stocks were traded on or before\\n1/2/2002. The total return on this portfolio in that year was –42 percent.\\nNow, let’s look at what we would have picked if our database had sur-\\nvivorship bias and actually missed all those stocks that were delisted that\\nyear. We would then have picked the following list instead:\\nSYMBOL Closing Price on 1/2/2001 Closing Price on 1/2/2002\\nMDM 0.3125 0.49\\nENGA 0.8438 0.44\\nNEOF 0.875 27.9\\nENP 0.875 0.05\\nMVL 0.9583 2.5\\nURBN 1.0156 3.0688\\nFNV 1.0625 0.81\\nAPT 1.125 0.88\\nFLIR 1.2813 9.475\\nRAZF 1.3438 0.25\\n41'),\n",

What this means is that even when\\nyou had placed a buy limit order below the recorded high of a day, it\\nmight not have been ﬁlled, and vice versa for a sell limit order. (This\\ncould be due to the fact that a very small order was transacted at the\\nhigh, or the execution could have occurred on a market to which\\nyour order was not routed. Sometimes, the high or low is simply\\ndue to an incorrectly reported tick that was not ﬁltered out.) Hence,\\na backtest that relies on high and low data is less reliable than one\\nthat relies on the open and close.\\nActually, sometimes even a market on open (MOO) or market\\non close (MOC) order might not be ﬁlled at the historical open\\nand close prices shown in your data. This is due to the fact that\\nthe historical prices shown may be due to the primary exchange\\n(e.g., New York Stock Exchange [NYSE]), or it may be a composite\\nprice including all the regional exchanges. Depending on where your\\norder was routed, it may be ﬁlled at a different price from the his-\\ntorical opening or closing price shown in your dataset. Neverthe-\\nless, the discrepancies of the open and close prices usually have\\nless impact on backtest performance than the errors in the high\\nand low prices, since the latter almost always inﬂate your backtest\\nreturns.\\nAfter retrieving the data from a database, it is often advisable to\\ndo a quick error check. The simplest way to do this is to calculate\\nthe daily returns based on the data. If you have open, high, low, and\\nclose prices, you can calculate the various combinations of daily\\nreturns such as from the previous high to today’s close as well. You'),\n",

Notice that I did not include average an-\\nnualized returns, the measure most commonly quoted by investors,\\nbecause if you use this measure, you have to tell people a number\\nof things about what denominator you use to calculate returns. For\\nexample, in a long-short strategy, did you use just one side of capital\\nor both sides in the denominator? Is the return a leveraged one (the\\ndenominator is based on account equity), or is it unleveraged (the\\ndenominator is based on market value of the portfolio)? If the equity\\nor market value changes daily, do you use a moving average as the\\ndenominator, or just the value at the end of each day or each month?\\nMost (but not all) of these problems associated with comparing re-\\nturns can be avoided by quoting Sharpe ratio and drawdown instead\\nas the standard performance measures.\\nI introduced the concepts of the Sharpe ratio, maximum draw-\\ndown, and maximum drawdown duration in Chapter 2. Here, I will\\njust note a number of subtleties associated with calculating the\\nSharpe ratio, and give some computational examples in both Excel\\nand MATLAB.\\nThere is one subtlety that often confounds even seasoned port-\\nfolio managers when they calculate Sharpe ratios: should we or\\nshouldn’t we subtract the risk-free rate from the returns of a dollar-\\nneutral portfolio?

Meanwhile, the mar-\\ngin balance you have to maintain earns a credit interest close to the\\nrisk-free raterF. So let’s say the strategy return (the portfolio return\\nminus the contribution from the credit interest) isR, and the risk-\\nfree rate isrF. Then the excess return used in calculating the Sharpe\\nratio isR + rF – rF = R. So, essentially, you can ignore the risk-free\\nrate in the whole calculation and just focus on the returns due to\\nyour stock positions.\\nSimilarly, if you have a long-only day-trading strategy that does\\nnot hold positions overnight, you again have no need to subtract the\\nrisk-free rate from the strategy return in order to obtain the excess\\nreturns, since you do not have ﬁnancing costs in this case, either. In\\ngeneral, you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy\\nreturns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs\\nﬁnancing cost.\\nTo further facilitate comparison across strategies, most traders\\nannualize the Sharpe ratio. Most people know how to annualize the\\naverage returns. For example, if you have been using monthly re-\\nturns, then the average annual return is just 12 times the average\\nmonthly return.\\nHowever, annualizing the standard deviation of returns is a bit\\ntrickier. Here, based on the assumption that the monthly returns are\\nserially uncorrelated (Sharpe, 1994), the annual standard deviation\\nof returns is\\n√\\n12 times the monthly standard deviation. Hence, over-\\nall, the annualized Sharpe ratio would be\\n√\\n12 times the monthly\\nSharpe ratio.\\nIn general, if you calculate your average and standard deviation\\nof returns based on a certain trading periodT, whether T is a month,\\na day, or an hour, and you want to annualize these quantities, you\\nhave to ﬁrst ﬁnd out how many such trading periods there are in a\\nyear (call itNT). Then\\nAnnualized Sharpe Ratio=\\n√\\nNT × Sharpe Ratio Based onT'),\n",

The ﬁrst step in this calculation is to calculate the “high\\nwatermark” at the close of each day, which is the maximum cumulative re-\\nturn of the strategy up to that time. (Using the cumulative return curve to\\ncalculate high watermark and drawdown is equivalent to using the equity\\ncurve, since equity is nothing more than initial investment times 1 plus the\\ncumulative return.) From the high watermark, we can calculate the draw-\\ndown, the maximum drawdown, and maximum drawdown duration.\\nUsing Excel\\n1. In cell M3, type “=L3”.\\n2. In cell M4, type “=(1+M3) *(1+L4)-1”. This is the cumulative com-\\npounded return of the strategy up to that day.

In cell O1506, type “=MAX(O3:O1505)”. This is the maximum draw-\\ndown of the strategy. It should have a value of about 0.1053, that is, a\\nmaximum drawdown of 10.53 percent.\\n7. In cell P3, type “=IF(O3=0, 0, P2+1)”. This is the duration of the current\\ndrawdown. Populate the entire column R with the drawdown durations\\nof the strategy and erase the last cell of the column.\\n8. In cell P1506, type “=MAX(P3:P1505)”.

I will describe two of the most common ones here,\\nwith tips on how to avoid them.\\nLook-Ahead Bias\\nThis error refers to the situation when you are using information\\nthat was available only at a timeahead of the instant the trade was\\nmade. For example, if your trade entry rule reads: “Buy when the\\nstock is within 1 percent of the day’s low,” you have introduced a\\nlook-ahead bias in your strategy, because you could not possibly\\nhave known what the day’s low was until the market closed that\\nday. Another example: Suppose a model involves a linear regression\\nﬁt of two price series. If you use the regression coefﬁcients obtained\\nfrom the entire data set to determine your daily trading signals, you\\nhave again introduced look-ahead bias.\\nHow do we avoid look-ahead bias? Uselagged historical data\\nfor calculating signals at every opportunity. Lagging a series of data\\nmeans that you calculate all the quantities like moving averages,\\nhighs and lows, or even volume, based on data up to the close of the\\nprevious trading period only. (Of course, you needn’t lag the data if\\nyour strategy enters only at the close of the period.)\\nLook-ahead bias is easier to avoid using Excel or other WYSI-\\nWYG programs than using MATLAB. This is because it is easy to\\nalign all the different columns of data in Excel and ensure that the\\nformula in each cell is computed based on the rows above the cur-\\nrent row. It would be visually obvious when one is using current\\nday’s data in generating signals, given the cell-highlighting function-\\nality in Excel. (Double-clicking a cell with a formula will highlight\\nthe cells of data this formula utilizes.) With MATLAB, you have to\\nbe more careful and remember to run a lag function on certain se-\\nries used for signal generation.\\nEven with all the care and caution that goes into creating a\\nbacktest program without look-ahead bias, sometimes we may\\nstill let some of it slip in. Some look-ahead bias is quite subtle in\\nnature and not easy to avoid, especially if you are using MATLAB.'),\n",

Now truncate your historical data so\\nthat the most recent portion (sayN days) is removed. So if the last\\nday in the original data isT, then the last day in the truncated data\\nshould beT-N. N could be 10 days to 100 days. Now run the back-\\ntest program again using the truncated data and save the resulting\\npositions into a new ﬁle B. Truncate the most recentN rows of the\\npositions ﬁle A so that both A and B have the same number of rows\\n(days) in them, and the last day in both ﬁle A and B should beT-N.\\nFinally, check if A and B are identical in their positions. If not, you\\nhave a look-ahead bias in your backtest program that you must ﬁnd\\nand correct, because the discrepancies in positions mean that you\\nare inadvertently using the truncated part of the historical data (the\\npart that lies ahead of dayT-N) in determining the positions in ﬁle\\nA. I will illustrate this somewhat convoluted procedure at the end of\\nExample 3.6.\\nData-Snooping Bias\\nIn Chapter 2, I mentioned data-snooping bias—the danger that back-\\ntest performance is inﬂated relative to the future performance of\\nthe strategy because we have overoptimized the parameters of the\\nmodel based on transient noise in the historical data. Data snoop-\\ning bias is pervasive in the business of predictive statistical models\\nof historical data, but is especially serious in ﬁnance because of the\\nlimited amount of independent data we have. High-frequency data,\\nwhile in abundant supply, is useful only for high-frequency models.\\nAnd while we have stock market data stretching back to the early\\nparts of the twentieth century, only data within the past 10 years\\nare really suitable for building predictive model. Furthermore, as\\ndiscussed in Chapter 2, regime shifts may render even data that are\\njust a few years old obsolete for backtesting purposes. The less inde-\\npendent data you have, the fewer adjustable parameters you should\\nemploy in your trading model.'),\n",

Numerous choices one makes in creating a trad-\\ning model can be affected by repeated backtesting on the same\\ndata set—decisions such as whether to enter at the open or close,\\nwhether to hold the positions overnight, whether to trade large-cap\\nor mid-cap stocks. Often, these qualitative decisions are made to\\noptimize the backtest performance, but they may not be optimal go-\\ning forward. It is almost impossible to completely eliminate data-\\nsnooping bias as long as we are building data-driven models. How-\\never, there are ways to mitigate the bias.\\nSample Size The most basic safeguard against data-snooping bias\\nis to ensure that you have a sufﬁcient amount of backtest data rel-\\native to the number of free parameters you want to optimize. As a\\nrule of thumb, let’s assume that the number of data points needed\\nfor optimizing your parameters is equal to 252 times the number\\nof free parameters your model has. (This assumption of propor-\\ntionality is not based on any survey of the vast statistical litera-\\nture, but purely on experience.) So, for example, let’s assume you\\nhave a daily trading model with three parameters. Then you should\\nhave at least three years’ worth of backtest data with daily prices.\\nHowever, if you have a three-parameter trading model that updates\\npositions every minute, then you should have at least 252/390 year,\\nor about seven months, of one-minute backtest data. (Note that if\\nyou have a daily trading model, then even if you have seven months\\nof minute-by-minute data points, effectively you only have about\\n7 × 21 = 147 data points, far from sufﬁcient for testing a three-\\nparameter model.)\\nOut-of-Sample Testing Divide your historical data into two parts.\\nSave the second (more recent) part of the data for out-of-sample\\ntesting. When you build the model, optimize the parameters as well\\nas other qualitative decisions on the ﬁrst portion (called thetrain-\\ning set), but test the resulting model on the second portion (called'),\n",

(The two portions should be roughly equal in size, but if\\nthere is insufﬁcient training data, we should at least have one-third\\nas much test data as training data. The minimum size of the training\\nset is determined by the rule of thumb in the previous section.) Ide-\\nally, the set of optimal parameters and decisions for the ﬁrst part of\\nthe backtest period is also the optimal set for the second period, but\\nthings are rarely this perfect. The performance on the second part\\nof the data should at least be reasonable. Otherwise, the model has\\ndata-snooping bias built into it, and one way to cure it is to simplify\\nthe model and eliminate some parameters.\\nA more rigorous (albeit more computationally intensive)\\nmethod of out-of-sample testing is to use moving optimization of\\nthe parameters. In this case, the parameters themselves are con-\\nstantly adapting to the changing historical data, and data-snooping\\nbias with respect to parameters is eliminated. (See the sidebar on\\nparameterless trading models.)\\nPARAMETERLESS TRADING MODELS*\\nA portfolio manager whom I used to work for liked to proudly proclaim that\\nhis trading models have “no free parameters.” In keeping with the tradition of\\nsecrecy in our industry, he would not divulge his technique further.\\nLately, I have begun to understand what a trading model with no free pa-\\nrameters means. It doesn’t mean that it does not contain, for example, any\\nlookback period for calculating trends, or thresholds for entry or exit. I think\\nthat would be impossible. It just means that all such parameters aredynami-\\ncally optimized in a moving lookback window. This way, if you ask, “Does the\\nmodel have a ﬁxed proﬁt cap?,” the trader can honestly reply: “No, proﬁt cap is\\nnot an input parameter. It is determined by the model itself.”\\nThe advantage of a parameterless trading model is that it minimizes the\\ndanger of overﬁtting the model to multiple input parameters (the so-called\\n“data-snooping bias”). So the backtest performance should be much closer to\\nthe actual forward performance.\\n(Note that parameter optimization does not necessarily mean picking one\\nbest set of parameters that give the best backtest performance. Often, it is\\nbetter to make a trading decision based on some kind ofaverages over diﬀerent\\nsets of parameters.)\\nNow, it is quite computationally challenging to optimize all these parame-\\nters just in time for your next order, but it is often even more diﬃcult to do that\\nin a backtest, given that a multidimensional optimization needs to be performed'),\n",

As a result, I personally have seldom traded parameter-\\nless models, until I get to research my regime-switching model described in\\nExample 7.1. That model is almost parameterless (I left out a few parameters\\nfrom optimization because of a lack of time, not because of any technical dif-\\nﬁculties). How was I able to perform backtest parameter optimization within a\\nfew minutes in this case?

I will discuss paper trading in Chapter 5.\\nIf the strategy that you are testing comes from a published\\nsource, and you are just conducting a backtest to verify that the re-\\nsults are correct, then the entire period between the time of publi-\\ncation and the time that you tested the strategy is a genuine out-of-\\nsample period. As long as you do not optimize the parameters of the\\npublished model on the out-of-sample period, this period is as good\\nas paper trading the strategy.\\nExample 3.6: Pair Trading of GLD and GDX\\nThis example will illustrate how to separate the data into a training set and a\\ntest set. We will backtest a pair-trading strategy and optimize its parameters\\non the training set and look at the eﬀect on the test set.\\nGLD versus GDX is a good candidate for pair trading because GLD\\nreﬂects the spot price of gold, and GDX is a basket of gold-mining\\nstocks. It makes intuitive sense that their prices should move in tandem.\\nI have discussed this pair of ETFs extensively on my blog in connec-\\ntion with cointegration analysis (see, e.g., epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/'),\n",

Do you\\nreally need, say, ﬁve different conditions to determine whether\\nto make that trade? What if you eliminate the conditions one\\nby one—at what point does the performance on the training set\\ndeteriorate to an unacceptable level? And more important: Is there\\na corresponding decrease in performance on the test set as you\\neliminate the conditions? In general, you should eliminate as many\\nconditions, constraints, and parameters as possible as long as\\nthere is no signiﬁcant decrease in performance in the test set, even\\nthough it may decrease performance on the training set. (But you\\nshould not add conditions and parameters, or adjust the parameter\\nvalues, so as to improve performance on the test set: If you do, you\\nhave effectively used the test set as your training set and possibly\\nreintroduce data-snooping bias to your model.)\\nWhen one has reduced the set of parameters and conditions that\\ntrigger a trade to the minimum, and after one has ascertained that\\nsmall variations in these parameters and conditions do not drasti-\\ncally alter the out-of-sample performance, one should consider di-\\nviding the trading capital across the different parameter values and\\nsets of conditions.

It should not\\nsurprise you to ﬁnd that a strategy with a high Sharpe ratio before\\nadding transaction costs can become very unproﬁtable after adding\\nsuch costs. I will illustrate this in Example 3.7.\\nExample 3.7: A Simple Mean-Reverting Model with and\\nwithout Transaction Costs\\nHere is a simple mean-reverting model that is due to Amir Khan-\\ndani and Andrew Lo at MIT (available at web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/\\naugust07.pdf). This strategy is very simple: Buy the stocks with the worst\\nprevious one-day returns, and short the ones with the best previous one-\\nday returns. Despite its utter simplicity, this strategy has had great perfor-\\nmance since 1995, ignoring transaction costs (it has a Sharpe ratio of 4.47\\nin 2006). Our objective here is to ﬁnd out what would happen to its perfor-\\nmance in 2006 if we assume a standard 5-basis-point-per-trade transaction\\ncost. (A trade is deﬁned as a buy or a short, not a round-trip transaction.)\\nThis example strategy not only allows us to illustrate the impact of trans-\\naction costs, it also illustrates the power of MATLAB in backtesting a model\\nthat trades multiple securities—in other words, a typical statistical arbitrage\\nmodel. Backtesting a model with a large number of symbols over multiple\\nyears is often too cumbersome to perform in Excel. But even assuming that\\nyou have MATLAB at your disposal, there is still the question of how to re-\\ntrieve historical data for hundreds of symbols, especially survivorship-bias-\\nfree data. Here, we will put aside the question of survivorship bias because\\nof the expensive nature of such data and just bear in mind that whatever\\nperformance estimates we obtained are upper bounds on the actual perfor-\\nmance of the strategy.\\nWhenever one wants to backtest a stock selection strategy, the ﬁrst\\nquestion is always: Which universe of stocks? The typical starting point is\\nthe S&P 500 stock universe, which is the most liquid set of stocks avail-\\nable. The current list of stocks in the S&P 500 is available for download at\\nthe Standard & Poor’s website (www.standardandpoors.com). Since the con-\\nstituents of this universe change constantly, the list that you download will\\nbe diﬀerent from mine. For ease of comparison, you can ﬁnd my list saved\\nas epchan.com/book/SP500 20071121.xls. The easiest way to download\\nhistorical data for all these stocks is to buy a copy of the HQuote Pro soft-\\nware (referenced earlier in this chapter, available from HQuote.com.) This'),\n",

How to reﬁne a\\nstrategy without introducing data-snooping bias and to remain sim-\\nple with few parameters is more of an art than a science. The guid-\\ning principle is the same as that of parameter optimization: What-\\never changes you make to the strategy to improve its performance\\non the training set, it must also improve the performance on the\\ntest set.\\nOften, there are some very simple strategies that are fairly well\\nknown in traders’ circles and are still somewhat proﬁtable, though\\ntheir returns seem to be diminishing. An example is the pair trad-\\ning of stocks. The reason they are diminishing in returns is that too\\nmany traders are taking advantage of this arbitrage opportunity and\\ngradually erasing the proﬁt margin. However, it is often possible to\\nintroduce minor variations in the basic strategy, which will boost its\\nreturns.\\nThese minor variations are often far less well known than the\\nbasic strategy, and therefore far less well exploited by traders.\\nSometimes they involve excluding certain stocks or groups of stocks\\nfrom the universe. For example, traders often prefer to exclude'),\n",

Dark-pool liquid-\\nity is formed by institutional orders facilitated away from the ex-\\nchanges, or they come from the crossing of internal brokerage cus-\\ntomer orders. These orders are not displayed as bid and ask quotes.\\nSome of the “alternative trading systems” that provide dark-pool\\nliquidity are Liquidnet and ITG’s Posit. Your brokerage may use one\\nor more of these providers, it may only use its internal crossing net-\\nwork, or it may use no alternative trading systems at all.\\nSometimes, a better execution price at a large brokerage due\\nto its state-of-the-art execution system and high-speed access to\\ndeeper dark pools of liquidity will more than compensate for its\\nhigher commissions. This kind of cost/beneﬁt analysis cannot eas-\\nily be carried out unless you actually trade on multiple brokerages\\nsimultaneously and compare the actual execution costs.\\nFor example, I trade through Goldman Sachs’s REDIPlus trading\\nplatform, whose Sigma X execution engine routes orders to both its\\ninternal crossing network as well as to external liquidity providers.\\nI have found that it often improves my execution price by more than\\na few cents per share over execution on Interactive Brokers: more\\nthan enough to offset its higher commissions.\\nAnother consideration is the range of products you can trade.\\nMany retail brokerages or proprietary trading ﬁrms do not allow you\\nto trade futures or foreign currencies. This would be a serious limi-\\ntation to your trading business’s growth.\\nFollowing these two fairly generic criteria, for a quantitative\\ntrader, the next important one is: Does the trading platform offer an\\napplication programming interface (API) so that your trading soft-\\nware can receive live data feed, generate orders, and automatically\\ntransmit the orders for execution in your account? I will discuss\\nmore about API in Chapter 5. The only point to note here is that\\nwithout an API, high-frequency quantitative trading is impossible.\\nClosely related to the availability of API is the availability of pa-\\nper trading accounts. If a brokerage does not offer you a paper trad-\\ning account, it is very hard to test an API without risking real losses.\\nAmong the brokerages I know that offer paper trading accounts are\\nInteractive Brokers, Genesis Securities, PFG Futures (for futures\\ntrading), and Oanda (for currency trading).'),\n",

This does not\\nmatter to the choice of a retail brokerage because, as noted in Ta-\\nble 4.1, retail accounts are insured by the SIPC whereas proprietary\\naccounts are not. Hence, it is important that a proprietary trading\\nﬁrm has a strong balance sheet and good risk management practices\\nto prevent the ﬁrm from collapsing because of bad trades made by\\nits fellow member traders. (WorldCom’s and Refco’s collapses are\\ngood examples.) You should also make sure the ﬁrm is a broker-\\ndealer registered with an exchange, so that it is regularly audited by\\nthe exchange and the SEC.

And, in\\nfact, sometimes each account has its own pros and cons, and you\\nmay want to have the ﬂexibility of keeping all of them open for trad-\\ning different strategies!\\nPHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\\nNow that you have set up the legal and administrative structure of\\nyour trading business, it is time to consider the physical infrastruc-\\nture. This applies to both retail and proprietary traders: Many pro-\\nprietary trading ﬁrms allow their members to trade remotely in their\\nhomes. If you are a proprietary trader who requires minimal coach-\\ning from your account manager and are conﬁdent in your ability to\\nset up the physical trading infrastructure yourself, there is no reason\\nnot to trade remotely.\\nIn the start-up phase of your business, the physical infrastruc-\\nture can be light and simple. You probably have all the compo-\\nnents you need in your home ofﬁce already: a good personal com-\\nputer (practically any new computer with dual-core processors will\\ndo), a high-speed (DSL or cable) Internet connection, and, less well\\nknown, an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) so that your com-\\nputer doesn’t get accidentally shut down in the middle of a trade be-\\ncause of electricity ﬂuctuations. The total initial investment should\\nnot exceed a couple of thousand dollars at the maximum, and the\\nmonthly cost should not be more than $50 or so if you don’t already\\nsubscribe to cable TV.\\nSome traders wonder if having a TV tuned to CNBC or CNN\\nis a good idea. While it certainly won’t hurt, many professional\\nquantitative traders have found that it is not necessary, as long as\\nthey also subscribe to another professional real-time newsfeed, such\\nas Thomson Reuters, Dow Jones, or Bloomberg. While Bloomberg\\ncan cost almost $2,000 a month, various plans offered by Thomson\\nReuters and Dow Jones can cost as little as $100 to $200 (though\\nsome will require an annual contract). Bloomberg also has a free\\nInternet radio stream at www.bloomberg.com/tvradio/radio that an-\\nnounces breaking business news and commentaries. Also, instead'),\n",

(SeeEconomist, 2007a, or Oldﬁeld, 2007.)\\nAs your trading business grows, you may upgrade your infra-\\nstructure gradually. Perhaps you will purchase faster computers. A\\nquad-core computer at the time of this writing is considered fairly\\nhigh end. Of course, when you are reading this, an octal-core or bet-\\nter personal computer will probably be widely available. According\\nto a New York Timesarticle (Markoff, 2007), PCs with octal-core\\nchips will be available as soon as 2010.\\nYou will certainly want to purchase multiple monitors to hook\\nup to the same computer so that you have extended screen space\\nto monitor all the different trading applications and portfolios.\\nMaybe you will want to upgrade your Internet connection to a T1\\nline, too. As discussed in Chapter 2, any delay in the transmis-\\nsion of your order to your brokerage results in slippage, which\\nis quite real in terms of lost proﬁts. In fast-moving markets, ev-\\nery millisecond counts, and an upgrade in your Internet connection\\nspeed may well pay for itself very quickly. (A T1 line can cost any-\\nwhere from $700 to $1,500, whereas a cable/DSL connection is usu-\\nally under $50.

You can in-\\nstall your trading programs on a remote server located in a hosting\\ncompany; in fact, you can even “collocate” your computers contain-\\ning your trading programs at the hosting company.

For certain high-frequency systems, a fully\\nautomated system is indispensable, because any human interven-\\ntion will cause enough delay to seriously derail the performance.\\nHowever, a fully automated system is also complicated and costly\\nto build, often requiring professional programmers with knowledge\\nof high-performance programming languages such as Java, C#, or\\nC++in order to connect to your brokerage’s application program-\\nming interface (API).\\nFor lower-frequency quantitative trading strategies, there is a\\nsemiautomated alternative: One can generate the orders using pro-\\ngrams such as Excel or MATLAB, then submit those orders using\\nbuilt-in tools such as a basket trader or spread trader offered by your\\nbrokerage. If your brokerage provides a dynamic data exchange\\n(DDE) link to Excel (see below), you can also write a macro at-\\ntached to your Excel spreadsheet that allows you to submit orders\\nto the brokerage simply by running the macro. This way, there is\\nno need to build an application in a complicated programming lan-\\nguage. However, it does mean that you would have to perform quite\\na few manual steps in order to submit your orders.\\nWhether you have built a semiautomated or a fully automated\\ntrading system, there is often a need for input data beyond the prices\\nthat your brokerage or data vendor can readily provide you. For ex-\\nample, earnings estimates or dividends data are often not provided\\nas part of the real-time data stream. These nonprice data are typ-\\nically available free of charge from many web sites, but are usu-\\nally embedded in an HTML format and not readily usable. Hence,\\nan automated system also must be able to retrieve such web pages,\\nparse them, and reformat them into a tabular format that your trad-\\ning strategy can utilize. Such web page retrieval and parsing pro-\\ngrams can readily be implemented in MATLAB (see Example 3.1 in\\nChapter 3), or in other scripting languages such as Perl.\\nI will discuss some details of the two kinds of system in the\\nfollowing sections. I will also discuss how to hire a programming'),\n",

Again, before the\\nmarket opens I use MATLAB to retrieve market data, run the pair-\\ntrading algorithm, and write out limit prices for all the pairs in my\\nuniverse. (Note that the limit prices are limits on the spread, not on\\nthe individual stocks. If they were on the individual stocks, ordinary\\nlimit orders would have done the trick and the spread trader would\\nhave been redundant.)

Unfor-\\ntunately, no brokerage that I know of provides an API for MATLAB.\\nHence, MATLAB cannot be used to build the order transmission por-\\ntion of an automated trading system.\\nTheoretically, a fully automated system can be constructed out\\nof an Excel spreadsheet and an attached macro: All you have to\\ndo is to create a loop in your macro so that it updates the cells\\nusing the DDE links and submit orders when appropriate contin-\\nuously throughout the day. Unfortunately, data updates through\\nDDE links are slow, and generally your brokerage limits the num-\\nber of symbols that you can update all at once.

If you have an account at one of the brokerages that supply you with\\nan API, the brokerage can often refer you to some programmers who have ex-\\nperience with their API. (Interactive Brokers, for example, has a special web\\npage that allows programming consultants to oﬀer their services.)

Of course, you can have\\nthem sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs, downloadable for free at many\\nlegal document web sites), but it is almost impossible to ﬁnd out if the pro-\\ngrammers are in fact running your strategies in their personal accounts once\\nthe programs are implemented.

So in this case, the ﬁrst programmer does not know your strategy,\\nand the second programmer does not have the infrastructure to execute the\\nstrategy. Furthermore, neither programmer knows the actual parameter values\\nto use for your strategy.\\nMINIMIZING TRANSACTION COSTS\\nWe saw in Chapter 3 how transaction costs can impact a strategy’s\\nactual return. Besides changing your brokerage or proprietary trad-\\ning ﬁrm to one that charges a lower commission, there are a few\\nthings you can do in your execution method to minimize the trans-\\naction costs.\\nTo cut down on commissions, you can refrain from trading low-\\nprice stocks. Typically, institutional traders do not trade any stocks\\nwith prices lower than $5. Not only do low-price stocks increase\\nyour total commissions costs (since you need to buy or sell more\\nshares for a ﬁxed amount of capital), percentage-wise they also have\\na wider bid-ask spread and therefore increase your total liquidity\\ncosts.\\nIn order to minimize market impact cost, you should limit the\\nsize (number of shares) of your orders based on the liquidity of the\\nstock. One common measure of liquidity is the average daily volume\\n(it is your choice what lookback period you want to average over).\\nAs a rule of thumb, each order should not exceed 1 percent of the\\naverage daily volume. As an independent trader, you may think that\\nit is not easy to reach this 1 percent threshold, and you would be\\nright when the stock in question is a large-cap stock belonging to\\nthe S&P 500. However, you may be surprised by the low liquidity of\\nsome small-cap stocks out there.\\nFor example, at the time of this writing, IRN is a stock in the S&P\\n600 SmallCap Index. It has a three-month average volume of about\\n51,000, and it closed today at $4.45. So 1 percent of this average\\nvolume is just 510 shares, which are worth only $2,269!\\nAnother way to reduce market impact is to scale the size of your\\norders based on the market capitalization of a stock.

A linear scale (i.e., scaling the capital\\nof a stock to be linearly proportional to its market capitalization)\\nwould result in practically zero weights for most small- and micro-\\ncap stocks in your portfolio, and this will take away any beneﬁts of\\ndiversiﬁcation. If we were to use linear scale, the capital weight of\\nthe largest large-cap stock will be about 10,000 of the smallest small-\\ncap stock. To reap the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation, we should not al-\\nlow that ratio to be more than 10 or so, provided that the liquidity\\n(volume) constraint described above is also satisﬁed. If the capital\\nweight of a stock is proportional to the fourth root of its market cap,\\nit would do the trick.\\nThere is one other way to reduce market impact. Many insti-\\ntutional traders who desire to execute a large order will break it\\ndown into many smaller orders and execute them over time. This\\nmethod of trading will certainly reduce market impact; however,\\nit engenders another kind of transactions costs, namely, slippage.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, slippage is the difference between the\\nprice that triggers the trading signal and the average execution price\\nof the entire order. Because the order is executed over a period\\nof time, slippage can be quite large. Since reducing market impact\\nin this way may increase slippage, it is not really suitable for retail\\ntraders whose order size is usually not big enough to require this\\nremedy.\\nSometimes, however, slippage is outside of your control: Per-\\nhaps your brokerage’s execution speed is simply too slow, due to\\neither software issues (their software processes your orders too\\nslowly), risk control issues (your order has to be checked against\\nyour account’s buying power and pass various risk control criteria\\nbefore it can be routed to the exchange), or pipeline issues (the bro-\\nkerage’s speed of access to the exchanges). Or perhaps your bro-\\nkerage does not have access to deep enough “dark-pool” liquidity.\\nThese execution costs and issues should affect your choice of bro-\\nkerages, as I pointed out in Chapter 4.'),\n",

If the backtest performance\\ncompletely fell apart after this exercise, chances are you do have\\nthis bias and it is time to look for a new strategy. If the backtest\\nperformance is still reasonable, your poor live trading performance\\nmay just be due to bad luck.\\nRegime shifts refer to the situation when the ﬁnancial market\\nstructure or the macroeconomic environment undergoes a drastic\\nchange so much so that trading strategies that were proﬁtable be-\\nfore may not be proﬁtable now.\\nThere are two noteworthy regime shifts in recent years re-\\nlated to market (or regulatory) structure that may affect certain\\nstrategies.\\nThe ﬁrst one is the decimalization of stock prices. Prior to early\\n2001, stock prices in the United States were quoted in multiples of\\none-sixteenth and one-eighteenth of a penny. Since April 9, 2001, all\\nU.S. stocks have been quoted in decimals. This seemingly innocuous\\nchange has had a dramatic impact on the market structure, which\\nis particularly negative for the proﬁtability of statistical arbitrage\\nstrategies.\\nThe reason for this may be worthy of a book unto itself. In a\\nnutshell, decimalization reduces frictions in the price discovery pro-\\ncess, while statistical arbitrageurs mostly act as market makers and\\nderive their proﬁts from frictions and inefﬁciencies in this process.\\n(This is the explanation given by Dr. Andrew Sterge in a Columbia\\nUniversity ﬁnancial engineering seminar titled “Where Have All the\\nStat Arb Proﬁts Gone?” in January 2008. Other industry practitioners\\nhave made the same point to me in private conversations.) Hence,\\nwe can expect backtest performance of statistical arbitrage strate-\\ngies prior to 2001 to be far superior to their present-day perfor-\\nmance.\\nThe other regime shift is relevant if your strategy shorts\\nstocks.'),\n",

This plus-tick rule\\nwas eliminated by the SEC in June 2007. Therefore, your backtest\\nresults for a strategy that shorts stocks may show an artiﬁcially in-\\nﬂated performance prior to 2007 relative to their actual realizable\\nperformance in those days.\\nActually, there is another problem with realizing the backtest\\nperformance of a strategy that shorts stocks apart from this regula-\\ntory regime shift. Even without the plus-tick rule, many stocks, es-\\npecially the small-cap ones or the ones with low liquidity, are “hard\\nto borrow.” For you to be able to short a stock, your broker has to\\nbe able to borrow it from someone else (usually a large mutual fund\\nor other brokerage clients) and lend it to you for selling.

Dr. Edward Thorp, whom I mentioned in the pref-\\nace, has written an excellent expository article on this subject in one\\nof his papers (Thorp, 1997), and I shall follow his discussion closely\\nin this chapter. (Dr. Thorp’s discussion is centered on a portfolio of\\nsecurities, and mine is constructed around a portfolio of strategies.\\nHowever, the mathematics are almost identical.)\\nEvery optimization problem begins with an objective. Our ob-\\njective here is to maximize our long-term wealth—an objective that\\nI believe is not controversial for the individual investor. Maximiz-\\ning long-term wealth is equivalent to maximizing the long-term com-\\npounded growth rateg of your portfolio. Note that this objective im-\\nplicitly means that ruin (i.e., equity’s going to zero or less because of\\na loss) must be avoided. This is because if ruin can be reached with\\nnonzero probability at some point, the long-term wealth is surely\\nzero, as is the long-term growth rate.\\n(In all of the discussions, I assume that we reinvest all trading\\nproﬁts, and therefore it is the levered, compounded growth rate that\\nis of ultimate importance.)\\nOne approximation that I will make is that the probability dis-\\ntribution of the returns of each of the trading strategyi is Gaussian,\\nwith a ﬁxed meanmi and standard deviationsi. (The returns should\\nbe net of all ﬁnancing costs; that is, they should be excess returns.)\\nThis is a common approximation in ﬁnance, but it can be quite\\ninaccurate. Certain big losses in the ﬁnancial markets occur with\\nfar higher frequencies (or viewed alternatively, at far higher magni-\\ntudes) than Gaussian probability distributions will allow. However,\\nevery scientiﬁc or engineering endeavor starts with the simplest\\nmodel with the crudest approximation, and ﬁnance is no excep-\\ntion. I will discuss the remedies to such inaccuracies later in this\\nchapter.\\nLet’s denote the optimal fractions of your equity that you should\\nallocate to each of yourn strategies by a column vectorF∗ = ( f ∗\\n1 ,\\nf ∗\\n2 ,..., f ∗\\nn )T.

Here is the simple mathematical embodiment\\nof this fact.\\nExample 6.2: Calculating the Optimal Leverage Based on the\\nKelly Formula\\nLet’s see an example of the Kelly formula at work. Suppose our portfolio\\nconsists of just a long position in SPY, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) track-\\ning the S&P 500 index. Let’s suppose that the mean annual return of SPY is\\n11.23 percent, with an annualized standard deviation of 16.91 percent, and\\nthat the risk-free rate is 4 percent. Hence, the portfolio has an annual mean\\nexcess return of 7.231 percent and an annual standard deviation of 16.91\\npercent, giving it a Sharpe ratio of 0.4275. The optimal leverage according\\nto the Kelly formula is f = 0.07231/0.16912 = 2.528. (Notice one inter-\\nesting tidbit: The Kelly f is independent of time scale, so it actually does\\nnot matter whether you annualize your return and standard deviation, as\\nopposed to Sharpe ratio which is time scale dependent.) Finally, the annu-\\nalized compounded, levered growth rate is 13.14 percent, which includes\\nthe ﬁnancing costs.\\nYou can verify these numbers yourselves by downloading the SPY daily\\nprices from Yahoo! Finance and computing the various quantities on a\\nspreadsheet. I did that on December 29, 2007, and my spreadsheet is avail-\\nable at epchan.com/book/example6 2.xls. In column H, I have computed\\nthe daily returns of the (adjusted) closing prices of SPY, while in row 3760\\nstarting at column H, I have computed the (annualized) mean return of\\nSPY, the standard deviation of SPY, the mean excess return of the portfo-\\nlio, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, the Kelly leverage, and, ﬁnally, the\\ncompounded growth rate.\\nThe Kelly leverage of 2.528 that we computed is saying that, for this\\nstrategy, if you have $100,000 in cash to invest, and if you really be-\\nlieve the expected values of your returns and standard deviations, you\\nshould borrow money to buy $252,800 worth of SPY. Furthermore, ex-\\npect an annual compounded return on your $100,000 investment to be\\n13.14 percent.\\nFor comparison, let’s see what compounded growth rate we will get if\\nwe did not leverage our investment (see the formula in the appendix to this\\nchapter): g = r + m− s2/2 = 0.1123 − (0.1691)2/2 = 9.8 percent. This, and\\nnot mean annual return of 11.23 percent, is the long-term growth rate of\\nbuying SPY with cash only.'),\n",

Because the optimal leverage of 2.528 times the current equity\\nof $74,720 is $188,892.\\nAs a practical procedure, this continuous updating of the capi-\\ntal allocation should occur at least once at the end of each trading\\nday. In addition to updating the capital allocation, one should also\\nperiodically update F* itself by recalculating the most recent trail-\\ning mean return and standard deviation.

If you hold your positions for only one day or so, then as a\\nrule of thumb, I would advise using a lookback period of six months.\\nUsing a relatively short lookback period has the advantage of allow-\\ning you to gradually reduce your exposure to strategies that have\\nbeen losing their performance. As for the frequency of update, it\\nshould not be a burden to updateF* daily once you have written a\\nprogram to do so.\\nOne last point: Some strategies generate a variable number of\\ntrading signals each day, which may result in a variable number of\\npositions and thus total capital each day. How should the Kelly for-\\nmula be used to determine the capital in this case when we don’t\\nknow what it will be beforehand?

In fact, the\\nSPY example (6.2) illustrated that the Kelly formula would advise\\nyou to reduce the portfolio size in the face of trading losses.

(The other face of the coin is that optimal leverage dic-\\ntates that you should increase your position size when your strategy\\ngenerates proﬁts.) This kind of selling is believed by some analysts\\nto be the cause of “ﬁnancial contagion” affecting many large hedge\\nfunds simultaneously when one faces a large loss.\\nAn example of this is the summer 2007 meltdown, described in\\nthe previously cited article “What Happened to the Quants in Au-\\ngust 2007?” by Amir Khandani and Andrew Lo. During August 2007,\\nunder the ominous cloud of a housing and mortgage default crisis,\\na number of well-known hedge funds experienced unprecedented\\nlosses, with Goldman Sachs’s Global Alpha fund falling 22.5 per-\\ncent. Several billion dollars evaporated within all of one week. Even\\nRenaissance Technologies Corporation, arguably the most success-\\nful quantitative hedge fund of all time, lost 8.7 percent in the ﬁrst\\nhalf of August, though it later recovered most of it. Not only is the\\nmagnitude of the loss astounding, but the widespread nature of it\\nwas causing great concern in the ﬁnancial community. Strangest of\\nall, few of these funds hold any mortgage-backed securities at all,\\nostensibly the root cause of the panic. It therefore became a classic\\nstudy of ﬁnancial contagion as propagated by hedge funds.\\nThis kind of contagion occurs because a large loss by one hedge\\nfund causes it to sell off some large positions that it holds (whether\\nor not these are the positions that cause the loss in the ﬁrst place).\\nThis selling causes the prices of the securities to drop (or rise in\\nthe case of short positions). If other hedge funds are holding sim-\\nilar positions, they will then suffer large losses also, causing their\\nown risk management system to sell off their own positions, and on\\nand on. For example, in the summer of 2007, one large hedge fund\\nmight have been holding subprime mortgage-backed securities and\\nsuffered a large loss in that sector. Risk management then required\\nthat it sold off liquid stock positions in their portfolio which might,\\nup to that point, be unaffected by the subprime debacle. Because of\\nthe selling of such stock positions, other statistical arbitrage hedge\\nfunds that hold no mortgage-backed securities might now suffered\\nbig losses, and proceeded to sell their stocks as well.

A lower leverage\\nimplies a smaller size of the selling required for risk management.\\nSometimes, even taking the conservative half-Kelly formula may\\nbe too aggressive, and traders may want to limit their portfolio\\nsize further by additional constraints. This is because, as I pointed\\nout previously, the application of the Kelly formula to continuous\\nﬁnance is premised on the assumption that return distribution is\\nGaussian. (Finance is continuous in the sense that the outcomes of\\nmaking bets in the ﬁnancial market fall on a continuum of proﬁts or\\nlosses, as opposed to a game of cards where the outcomes fall into\\ndiscrete cases.) But, of course, the returns are not really Gaussian:\\nlarge losses occur at far higher frequencies than would be predicted\\nby a nice bell-shaped curve. Some people refer to the true distri-\\nbutions of returns as having “fat tails.” What this means is that the\\nprobability of an event far, far away from the mean is much higher\\nthan allowed by the Gaussian bell curve. These highly improbable\\nevents have been called “black swan” events by the author Nassim\\nTaleb (see Taleb, 2007).\\nTo handle extreme events that fall outside the Gaussian distri-\\nbution, we can use our simple backtest technique to roughly esti-\\nmate what the maximum one-period loss was historically. (The pe-\\nriod may be one week, one day, or one hour. The only criterion to\\nuse is that you should be ready to rebalance your portfolio accord-\\ning to the Kelly formula at the end of every period.) You should also\\nhave in mind what is the maximum one-period drawdown on your\\nequity that you are willing to suffer. Dividing the maximum tolera-\\nble one-period drawdown on equity by the maximum historical loss\\nwill tell you whether even half-Kelly leverage is too large for your\\ncomfort. The leverage to use is always the smaller of the half-Kelly\\nleverage and the maximum leverage obtained using the worst histor-\\nical loss.

Meanwhile, the leverage\\nrecommended by half-Kelly is 1.26. Hence, in this case, even half-\\nKelly leverage wouldnot be conservative enough to survive Black\\nMonday.\\nThe truly scary scenario in risk management is the one that\\nhas not occurred in history before. Echoing the philosopher Lud-\\nwig Wittgenstein, “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be\\nsilent”—on such unknowables, theoretical models are appropriately\\nsilent.\\nIS THE USE OF STOP LOSS A GOOD RISK\\nMANAGEMENT PRACTICE?\\nSome traders believe that good risk management means imposing stop loss on\\nevery trade; that is, if a position incurs a certain percent loss, the trader will\\nexit the position. It is a common fallacy to believe that imposing stop loss will\\nprevent the portfolio from suﬀering catastrophic losses. When a catastrophic\\nevent occurs, securities prices will drop discontinuously, so the stop loss orders\\nto exit the positions will only be ﬁlled at prices much worse than those before\\nthe event. So, by exiting the positions, we are actually realizing the catastrophic\\nloss and not avoiding it. For stop loss to be beneﬁcial, we must believe that we\\nare in a momentum, or trending, regime. In other words, we must believe that\\nthe prices will get worse within the expected lifetime of our trade. Otherwise, if\\nthe market is mean reverting within that lifetime, we will eventually recoup our\\nlosses if we didn’t exit the position too quickly.\\nOf course, it is not easy to tell whether one is in a momentum regime (when\\nstop loss is beneﬁcial) or in a mean-reverting regime (when stop loss is harm-\\nful). My own observation is that when the movement of prices is due to news\\nor other fundamental reasons (such as a company’s deteriorating revenue), one\\nis likely to be in a momentum regime, and one should not “stand in front of\\na freight train,” in traders’ vernacular. For example, if a fundamental analysis\\nof a company reveals that it is currently overvalued, its stock price will likely\\ngradually decrease (at least in relation to the market index) in order to reach\\na new, lower equilibrium price. This movement to the lower equilibrium price\\nis irreversible as long as the fundamental economics of the company does not\\nchange. However, when securities prices move drastically without any apparent\\nnews or reasons, it is likely that the move is the result of a liquidity event—for\\nexample, major holders of the securities suddenly need to liquidate large'),\n",

It could be wrong for a large number of\\nreasons, some of which were detailed in Chapter 3: data-snooping\\nbias, survivorship bias, and so on. To eliminate all these different\\nbiases and errors in the backtest programs, it is extremely helpful to\\nhave a collaborator or consultant to duplicate your backtest results\\nindependently to ensure their validity. This need to duplicate results\\nis routinely done in scientiﬁc research and is no less essential in\\nﬁnancial research.\\nModel risk can also come not from any bias or error in your\\nmodel or backtesting procedure, but from increased competition\\nfrom other institutional traders all running the same strategy as\\nyou; or it could be a result of some fundamental change in market\\nstructure that eliminated the edge of your trading model. This is the\\nregime shift that I talked about in Chapter 5.\\nThere is not much you can do to alleviate these sources of model\\nrisk, except to gradually lower the leverage of the model as it racks\\nup losses, up to the point where the leverage is zero. This can be ac-\\ncomplished in a systematic way if you constantly update the lever-\\nage according to the Kelly formula based on the trailing mean return\\nand standard deviation. (As the mean return decreases to zero in the\\nlookback period, your Kelly leverage will be driven to zero.)

I will try to highlight a few of the common irrational behav-\\niors that affect trading.\\nThe ﬁrst behavioral bias is known variously as theendowment\\neffect, status quo bias,o rloss aversion.

As I argued in the risk management section, there\\nare rational reasons to hold on to a losing position (e.g., when you\\nexpect mean-reverting behavior); however, these behavioral biases\\ncause traders to hold on to losing positions even when there is no\\nrational reason (e.g., when you expect trending behavior, and the\\ntrend is such that your positions will lose even more). At the same\\ntime, the loss aversion bias causes some traders to exit their prof-\\nitable positions too soon, even if holding longer will lead to a larger\\nproﬁt on average. Why do they exit the proﬁtable positions so soon?\\nBecause the pain from possibly losing some of the current proﬁts\\noutweighs the pleasure from gaining higher proﬁts.\\nThis behavioral bias manifests itself most clearly and most dis-\\nastrously when one has entered a position by mistake (because of\\neither a software bug, an operational error, or a data problem) and\\nhas incurred a big loss. The rational step to take is to exit the po-\\nsition immediately upon discovery of the error. However, traders\\nare often tempted to wait for mean reversion such that the loss is\\nsmaller before they exit. Unless you have a model for mean rever-\\nsion that suggests now is a good time to enter into this position,\\nthis wait for mean reversion may very well lead to bigger losses\\ninstead.\\nAnother common bias that I have personally experienced is the\\n“representativeness bias”—people tend to put too much weight on\\nrecent experience and underweight long-term average (Ritter, 2003).\\n(This reference has a good introduction to various biases studied\\nby behavioral ﬁnance.) After a big loss, traders—even quantitative\\ntraders—tend to immediately modify certain parameters of their\\nstrategies so that they would have avoided the big loss if they were\\nto trade this modiﬁed system. But, of course, this is unwise because\\nthis modiﬁcation may invite some other big loss that is yet to hap-\\npen, or it may have eliminated many proﬁt opportunities that ex-\\nisted. We must remember that we are operating in a probabilistic\\nregime: No system can avoid all the market vagaries that can result\\nin losses.\\nIf you feel that your system really is deﬁcient and want to tweak\\nit, you should always backtest the modiﬁed version to make sure'),\n",

Many traders (and their managers, investors, etc.) will\\nbe under great pressure under this circumstance to shut down the\\nmodel completely. Other overly self-conﬁdent traders with a reck-\\nless bent will do the opposite: They will double their bets on their\\nlosing models, hoping to recoup their losses eventually, if and when\\nthe models rebound. Neither behavior is rational: if you have been\\nmanaging your capital allocation and leverage by the Kelly for-\\nmula, you would lower the capital allocation for the losing model\\ngradually.\\nGreed is the more usual emotion when the model is having a\\ngood run and is generating a lot of proﬁts. The temptation now is to\\nincrease its leverage quickly in order to get rich quickly. Once again,\\na well-disciplined quantitative trader will keep the leverage below\\nthe dictates of the Kelly formula as well as the caution imposed by\\nthe possibility of fat-tail events.\\nBoth despair and greed can lead to overleveraging (i.e., trad-\\ning an overly large portfolio): In despair, one tries to recoup the\\nlosses by adding fresh capital; in greed, one adds capital too\\nquickly after initial successes with a strategy. Therefore, the one\\ngolden rule in risk management is to keep the size of your port-\\nfolio under control at all times. This is, however, easier said than\\ndone. Large, well-known funds have succumbed to the tempta-\\ntion to overleverage and failed: Long-Term Capital Management in\\n2000 (Lowenstein, 2000) and Amaranth Advisors in 2006 (epchan.\\nblogspot.com/2006/10/highly-improbable-event.html). In the Ama-\\nranth Advisors case, the leverage employed on one single strategy\\n(natural gas calendar spread trade) due to one single trader (Brian\\nHunter) is so large that a $6 billion dollar loss was incurred, com-\\nfortably wiping out the fund’s equity—a textbook case of risk mis-\\nmanagement.\\nI have experienced this pressure myself both in an institutional\\nsetting and in a personal setting, and the unfortunate result both'),\n",

The ultimate risk management\\nmind-set is very simple: Do not succumb to either despair or greed.\\nTo gain practice in this psychological discipline, one must proceed\\nslowly with small position size, and thoroughly test various aspects\\nof the trading business (model, software, operational procedure,\\nmoney and risk management) before scaling up according to the\\nKelly formula.\\nI have found that in order to proceed slowly and cautiously, it\\nis helpful to have other sources of income or other businesses to\\nhelp sustain yourself either ﬁnancially or emotionally (to avoid the\\nboredom associated with slow progress).

Otherwise, they are random-\\nwalking, and trading will be futile. If you believe that prices are mean\\nreverting and that they are currently low relative to some reference\\nprice, you should buy now and plan to sell higher later. However, if\\nyou believe the prices are trending and that they are currently low,\\nyou should (short) sell now and plan to buy at an even lower price\\nlater. The opposite is true if you believe prices are high.\\nAcademic research has indicated that stock prices areon av-\\nerage very close to random walking. However, this does not mean\\nthat under certain special conditions, they cannot exhibit some de-\\ngree of mean reversion or trending behavior. Furthermore, at any\\ngiven time, stock prices can be both mean reverting and trending\\ndepending on the time horizon you are interested in. Constructing a\\ntrading strategy is essentially a matter of determining if the prices\\nunder certain conditions and for a certain time horizon will be mean\\nreverting or trending, and what the initial reference price should be\\nat any given time. (When the prices are trending, they are also said\\nto have “momentum,” and thus the corresponding trading strategy\\nis often called amomentum strategy.)\\nSome people like to describe the phenomenon that prices can\\nbe both mean reverting and trending at the same time as the “frac-\\ntal” nature of stock prices. Technical analysts or chartists like to\\nuse the so-called Elliott wave theory to analyze such phenomena.\\nStill others like to use the discipline of machine learning or artiﬁ-\\ncial intelligence (in particular, techniques such as hidden Markov\\nmodels, Kalman ﬁlter, neural networks, etc.) to discover whether\\nthe prices are in a mean-reverting or trending “regime.” I person-\\nally have not found such general theories of mean reversion or mo-\\nmentum particularly useful. (See, however, the section on regime\\nswitching, which describes an apparently successful attempt to pre-\\ndict regime switch for one particular stock.) Rather, I ﬁnd it is usu-\\nally safe to assume that, unless the expected earnings of a company'),\n",

In fact, ﬁnancial\\nresearchers (Khandani and Lo, 2007) have constructed a very simple\\nshort-term mean reversal model that is proﬁtable (before transac-\\ntion costs) over many years. Of course, whether the mean reversion\\nis strong enough and consistent enough such that we can trade prof-\\nitably after factoring in transaction costs is another matter, and it is\\nup to you, the trader, to ﬁnd those special circumstances when it is\\nstrong and consistent.\\nThough mean reversion is quite prevalent, backtesting a prof-\\nitable mean-reverting strategy can be quite perilous.\\nMany historical ﬁnancial databases contain errors in price\\nquotes. Any such error tends to artiﬁcially inﬂate the performance\\nof mean-reverting strategies. It is easy to see why: a mean-reverting\\nstrategy will buy on a ﬁctitious quote that is much lower than some\\nmoving average and sell on the next correct quote that is in line with\\nthe moving average and thus makes a proﬁt. One must make sure the\\ndata is thoroughly cleansed of such ﬁctitious quotes before one can\\ncompletely trust your backtesting performance on a mean-reverting\\nstrategy.\\nSurvivorship bias also affects the backtesting of mean-reverting\\nstrategies disproportionately, as I discussed in Chapter 3. Stocks\\nthat went through extreme price actions are likely to be either ac-\\nquired (the prices went very high) or went bankrupt (the prices\\nwent to zeros). A mean-reverting strategy will short the former and\\nbuy the latter, losing money in both cases. However, these stocks\\nmay not appear at all in your historical database if it has survivor-\\nship bias, thus artiﬁcially inﬂating your backtest performance. You\\ncan look up Table 3.1 to ﬁnd out which database has survivor-\\nship bias.\\nMomentum can be generated by the slow diffusion of\\ninformation—as more people become aware of certain news, more\\npeople decide to buy or sell a stock, thereby driving the price in\\nthe same direction. I suggested earlier that stock prices may ex-\\nhibit momentum when the expected earnings have changed. This\\ncan happen when a company announces its quarterly earnings, and\\ninvestors either gradually become aware of this announcement or'),\n",

And indeed, this leads to\\na momentum strategy calledpost earnings announcement drift,or\\nPEAD. (For a particularly useful article with lots of references on\\nthis strategy, look up quantlogic.blogspot.com/2006/03/pocket-phd-\\npost-earning-announcment.html.) Essentially, this strategy recom-\\nmends that you buy a stock when its earnings exceed expectations,\\nand short a stock when it falls short. More generally, many news an-\\nnouncements have the potential of altering expectations of a stock’s\\nfuture earnings, and therefore have the potential to trigger a trend-\\ning period. As to what kind of news will trigger this, and how long\\nthe trending period will last, it is again up to you to ﬁnd out.\\nBesides the slow diffusion of information, momentum can be\\ncaused by the incremental execution of a large order due to the li-\\nquidity needs or private investment decisions of a large investor.\\nThis cause probably accounts for more instances of short-term mo-\\nmentum than any other causes. With the advent of increasingly so-\\nphisticated execution algorithms adopted by the large brokerages, it\\nis, however, increasingly difﬁcult to ascertain whether a large order\\nis behind the observed momentum.\\nMomentum can also be generated by the herdlike behavior of in-\\nvestors: investors interpret the (possibly random and meaningless)\\nbuying or selling decisions of others as the sole justiﬁcations of their\\nown trading decisions. As Yale economist Robert Schiller said in the\\nNew York Times(Schiller, 2008), nobody has all the information\\nthey need in order to make a fully informed ﬁnancial decision. One\\nhas to rely on the judgment of others. There is, however, no sure\\nway to discern the quality of the judgment of others. More problem-\\natically, people make their ﬁnancial decisions at different times, not\\nmeeting at a town hall and reaching a consensus once and for all.\\nThe ﬁrst person who paid a high price for a house is “informing”\\nthe others that houses are good investments, which leads another\\nperson to make the same decision, and so on. Thus, a possibly erro-\\nneous decision by the ﬁrst buyer is propagated as “information” to a\\nherd of others.\\nUnfortunately, momentum regimes generated by these two\\ncauses (private liquidity needs and herdlike behavior) have highly'),\n",

What are the effects\\nof increasing competition from traders with the same strategies?\\nFor mean-reverting strategies, the effect typically is the gradual\\nelimination of any arbitrage opportunity, and thus gradually dimin-\\nishing returns down to zero. When the number of arbitrage op-\\nportunities has been reduced to almost zero, the mean-reverting\\nstrategy is subject to the risk that an increasing percentage of\\ntrading signals are actually due to fundamental changes in stocks’\\nvaluation and thus is not going to mean revert. For momentum\\nstrategies, the effect of competition is often the diminishing of the\\ntime horizon over which the trend will continue. As news dissem-\\ninates at a faster rate and as more traders take advantage of this\\ntrend earlier on, the equilibrium price will be reached sooner. Any\\ntrade entered after this equilibrium price is reached will be unprof-\\nitable.\\nREGIME SWITCHING*\\nThe concept of regimes is most basic to ﬁnancial markets.

If only\\nit were that easy. The difﬁculty with predicting this type of switch-\\ning encourages researchers to look more broadly at other types of\\nregime switching in the ﬁnancial markets, hoping to ﬁnd some that\\nmay be more amenable to existing statistical tools.\\nI have already described two regime switches (or “shifts,” for\\nthese two examples did not switch back to their former regimes)\\nthat are due to changes in market and regulatory structures: deci-\\nmalization of stock prices in 2003 and the elimination of the short-\\nsale plus-tick rule in 2007. (See Chapter 5 for details.) These regime\\nshifts are preannounced by the government, so no predictions of\\nthe shifts are necessary, though few people can predict the exact\\nconsequences of the regulatory changes.\\nSome of the other most common ﬁnancial or economic regimes\\nstudied are inﬂationary vs. recessionary regimes, high- vs. low-\\nvolatility regimes, and mean-reverting vs. trending regimes. Among\\nthese, volatility regime switching seems to be most amenable to\\nclassical econometric tools such as the generalized autoregres-\\nsive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model (See Klaassen,\\n2002). That is not surprising, as there is a long history of success\\namong ﬁnancial economists in modeling volatilities as opposed to\\nthe underlying stock prices themselves. While such predictions of\\nvolatility regime switches can be of great value to options traders,\\nthey are unfortunately of no help to stock traders.\\nAcademic attempts to model regime switches in stock prices\\ngenerally proceed along these lines:\\n1. Propose that the two (or more) regimes are characterized by\\ndifferent probability distributions of the prices. In the simplest\\ncases, the log of the prices of both regimes may be represented\\nby normal distributions, except that they have different means\\nand/or standard deviations.\\n2. Assume that there is some kind of transition probability among\\nthe regimes.\\n3.

Based on the ﬁtted model above, ﬁnd out the expected regime\\nof the next time step and, more importantly, the expected stock\\nprice.\\nThis type of approach is usually calledMarkov regime switch-\\ning or hidden Markov models, and it is generally based on a\\nBayesian probabilistic framework. Readers who are interested in\\nreading more about some of these approaches may peruse Nielsen\\nand Olesen (2000), van Norden and Schaller (1993), or Kaufmann\\nand Scheicher (1996).\\nDespite the elegant theoretical framework, such Markov regime-\\nswitching models are generally useless for actual trading purposes.\\nThe reason for this weakness is that they assume constant tran-\\nsition probabilities among regimes at all times. In practice, this\\nmeans that at any time (as illustrated by the Nielsen and Olesen pa-\\nper), there is always a very small probability for the stock to tran-\\nsition from a normal, quiescent regime to a volatile regime. But this\\nis useless to traders who want to know when—and under what pre-\\ncise conditions—the transition probability will suddenly peak. This\\nquestion is tackled by the turning points models.\\nTurning points models take a data mining approach (Chai, 2007):\\nEnter all possible variables that might predict a turning point or\\nregime switch. Variables such as current volatility; last-period re-\\nturn; or changes in macroeconomic numbers such as consumer con-\\nﬁdence, oil price changes, bond price changes, and so on can all\\nbe part of this input. In fact, in a very topical article about turning\\npoints in the real estate market by economist Robert Schiller (2007),\\nit was suggested that the crescendo of media chatter about impend-\\ning boom or bust may actually be a good predictor of a coming turn-\\ning point.\\nIn Example 7.1, I illustrate how we might detect turning points\\nusing a data-mining approach with just simple technical indicators\\nbuilt on stock price series as inputs while using stock returns of\\nmultiple holding periods as outputs.'),\n",

This is nor-\\nmally a very onerous task, even with MATLAB. But, luckily, a recent machine\\nlearning program has enabled this discovery process to be done in a matter\\nof hours.\\nI shall employ a tool here called Alphacet Discovery, which is an inte-\\ngrated backtesting and execution platform recently launched by Alphacet,\\nInc. (www.alphacet.com. Full disclosure: Alphacet is a client of my ﬁrm.)\\nThis platform not only integrates all historical and real-time data needed\\nfor rapid strategy prototyping, backtesting, analysis, and real-time deploy-\\nment; it also contains an expanding array of machine learning programs\\nsuch as neural networks and genetic algorithms that are well suited to data\\nmining for the kind of relationships we are seeking.\\nI will pick a prominent brokerage stock—GS—as a proxy for the ﬁnan-\\ncial sector. My objective is to ﬁnd out if I can detect turning points in this\\nsector where it goes from bull to bear and back. My initial hypothesis is that\\nmajor shifts of interest rates, a release of government macroeconomic data,\\nor earnings announcements are likely triggers of turning points. At the time\\nof this writing, Alphacet had not yet completed integration of macroeco-\\nnomic or company news data into its database, so I will use a large percent\\nchange in GS as proxy for such news releases. Furthermore, I believe that\\nwhenever GS reaches an N-day high or low just before this large drop or\\nrise in prices occurs is a good signal that a previous regime is close to an\\nend. So I shall use this condition as an additional input as well.\\nThe search problem we face is: How large a percent change is suﬃcient\\nto trigger a regime switch? What should N be in the N-day high/low con-\\ndition? And how long does the new regime generally last? (In other words,\\nwhat is the optimal holding period?) To answer these questions in the old-\\nfashioned, manual way is very time consuming, as one has to run multi-\\nple simulations with diﬀerent thresholds for the independent variables and\\nmultiple return horizons for the dependent variables. Let’s see if Alphacet\\nDiscovery can help us automate this process.\\nThe independent variables of the model are just the one-day returns\\nof GS. The dependent variables are the future returns of GS within various\\nholding periods. Discovery can easily ﬁnd an optimal rule, or an optimal\\ncombination of rules, which will lead to the best backtest performance. In\\nour case, each percent-change threshold can be encapsulated as a rule. I\\nentered two thresholds for buys and two for shorts:−1p e r c e n t ,−3p e r c e n t ,'),\n",

However, the converse is\\nnot true. You don’t necessarily need a stationary price series in order\\nto have a successful mean-reverting strategy. Even a nonstationary\\nprice series can have many short-term reversal opportunities that\\none can exploit, as many traders have discovered.\\nMany pair traders are unfamiliar with the concepts of station-\\narity and cointegration. But most of them are familiar withcorrela-\\ntion, which superﬁcially seems to mean the same thing as cointe-\\ngration. Actually, they are quite different. Correlation between two\\nprice series actually refers to the correlations of their returns over\\nsome time horizon (for concreteness, let’s say a day). If two stocks\\nare positively correlated, there is a good chance that their prices\\nwill move in the same direction most days. However, having a posi-\\ntive correlation does not say anything about the long-term behavior\\nof the two stocks. In particular, it doesn’t guarantee that the stock\\nprices will not grow farther and farther apart in the long run even\\nif they do move in the same direction most days. However, if two\\nstocks were cointegrated and remain so in the future, their prices\\n(weighted appropriately) will be unlikely to diverge. Yet their daily\\n(or weekly, or any other time horizon) returns may be quite uncor-\\nrelated.\\nAs an artiﬁcial example of two stocks, A and B, that are coin-\\ntegrated but not correlated, see Figure 7.6. Stock B clearly doesn’t\\nmove in any correlated fashion with stock A: Some days they move\\nin the same direction, other days the opposite. Most days, stock B\\ndoesn’t move at all. But notice that the spread in stock prices be-\\ntween A and B always returns to about $1 after a while.\\nCan we ﬁnd real-life example of this phenomenon? Well, KO\\nversus PEP is one. In the program example7 3.m I have shown\\nthat they do not cointegrate. If, however, you test their daily re-\\nturns for correlation, you will ﬁnd that their correlation of 0.4849\\nis indeed statistically signiﬁcant. The correlation test is presented\\nat the end of the example7 3.m program and shown here in\\nExample 7.3.'),\n",

(Every one of these quantities is time dependent,\\nbut I suppress this explicit dependence for simplicity.)\\nThe terms factor exposure, factor return,a n dspeciﬁc return\\nare commonly used in quantitative ﬁnance, and it is well worth our\\neffort to understand their meanings. Factor returns are the com-\\nmon drivers of stock returns, and are therefore independent of a\\nparticular stock. Factor exposures are the sensitivities to each of\\nthese common drivers. Any part of a stock’s return that cannot be\\nexplained by these common factor returns is deemed a speciﬁc re-\\nturn (i.e., speciﬁc to a stock and essentially regarded as just random\\nnoise within the APT framework). Each stock’s speciﬁc return is as-\\nsumed to be uncorrelated to another stock’s.\\nLet’s illustrate these using a simple factor model called the\\nFama-French Three-Factor model (Fama and French, 1992). This\\nmodel postulates that the excess return of a stock depends linearly\\non only three factor exposures: its beta (i.e., its sensitivity to the\\nmarket index), its market capitalization, and its book-to-price ratio.\\nThese factor exposures are obviously different for each stock and\\nfor each time period. (Factor exposures are often normalized such\\nthat the average of the factor exposures within a universe of stocks\\nis zero, and the standard deviation is 1.)\\nNow that we know how to calculate the factor exposures, what\\nabout the factor returns and speciﬁc returns? We cannot directly\\ncompute the factor returns and speciﬁc returns—we have to infer\\ntheir values by running a multivariate linear regression of the excess\\nreturns of stocks against the factor exposures. Note that each stock\\nrepresents one data point in this linear regression, and we have to\\neither run a separate linear regression for each time period or, if\\nwe want an average value over many time periods, aggregate the\\nvalues from all these time periods into one training set and run one\\nregression against them all.\\nIf you perform this linear regression ﬁt over many time peri-\\nods for the Fama-French Three-Factor model, you will ﬁnd that\\nthe market capitalization factor return is usually negative (meaning'),\n",

And since most stocks\\nare positively correlated with the market index, the beta factor re-\\nturn is positive as well.\\nThe Fama-French model has no monopoly on the choice of\\nfactors. In fact, you can construct as many factors as creativity\\nand rationality allow. For example, you can choose return on eq-\\nuity as a factor exposure, or the correlation of the stock return\\nwith the prime rate as another. You can choose any number of\\nother economic, fundamental, or technical factors. Whether the\\nfactor exposures you have chosen are sensible or not will deter-\\nmine whether the factor model explains the excess returns of the\\nstocks adequately. If the factor exposures (and consequently the\\nmodel as a whole) are poorly chosen, the linear regression ﬁt will\\nproduce speciﬁc returns of signiﬁcant sizes, and the R2 statistic\\nof the ﬁt will be small. According to experts (Grinold and Kahn,\\n1999), the R2 statistic of a good factor model with monthly re-\\nturns of 1,000 stocks and 50 factors is typically about 30 percent to\\n40 percent.\\nIt may appear that these factor models are only explanatory in\\nretrospect—that is, given historical returns and factor exposures,\\nwe can compute the factor returns of those historical periods. But\\nwhat good are those historical factor returns for our trading? It turns\\nout that often factor returns are more stable than individual stock\\nreturns. In other words, they havemomentum. You can therefore\\nassume that their values remain unchanged from the current period\\n(known from the regression ﬁt) to the next time period. If this is\\nthe case, then, of course, you can also predict the excess returns,\\nas long as the factor exposures are well chosen and therefore the\\ntime-varying speciﬁc returns are not signiﬁcant.\\nLet me clarify one point of potential confusion. Even though\\nI stated that factor models can be useful as a predictive model\\n(and therefore for trading) only if we assume the factor returns\\nhave momentum, it does not mean that factor models cannot cap-\\nture mean reversion of stock returns.

To obtain historical values of these factor\\nexposures for a large portfolio of stocks so as to backtest a factor model\\nis usually quite expensive and not very practical to an independent trader.\\n(For those who are ﬁscally prepared to purchase such data, see the list in\\nthe main text.) However, there is one kind of factor model that relies on\\nnothing more than historical returns to construct. This method is the so-\\ncalled principal component analysis (PCA).\\nIf we use PCA to construct the factor exposures and factor returns, we\\nmust assume that the factor exposures are constant (time independent)\\nover the estimation period. (This rules out factors that represent mean re-\\nversion or momentum, since these factor exposures depend on the prior\\nperiod returns.) More importantly, we assume that the factor returns are\\nuncorrelated; that is to say, their covariance matrix ⟨bbT ⟩ is diagonal.

As The Economist\\nnoted, one reason growth stocks were back in favor in 2007 is the\\nsimple fact that their price premium over value stocks has narrowed\\nsigniﬁcantly (Economist,2007b). Another reason is that as the U.S.\\neconomy slowed, investors increasingly opted for companies that\\nstill managed to generate increasing earnings instead of those that\\nwere hurt by the recessionary economy.\\nTherefore, it is not uncommon for factor models to experi-\\nence steep drawdown during the times when investors’ valuation\\nmethod shifts, even if only for a short duration.

They\\nare based on one of these:\\nr A ﬁxed holding period\\nr A target price or proﬁt cap\\nr The latest entry signals\\nr As t o pp r i c e\\nA ﬁxed holding period is the default exit strategy for any trad-\\ning strategy, whether it is a momentum model, a reversal model, or\\nsome kind of seasonal trading strategy, which can be either momen-\\ntum or reversal based. (More on this later.) I said before that one of\\nthe ways momentum is generated is the slow diffusion of informa-\\ntion. In this case, the process has a ﬁnite lifetime. The average value\\nof this ﬁnite lifetime determines the optimal holding period, which\\ncan usually be discovered in a backtest.\\nOne word of caution on determining the optimal holding period\\nof a momentum model: As I said before, this optimal period typically\\ndecreases due to the increasing speed of the diffusion of information\\nand the increasing number of traders who catch on to this trading\\nopportunity. Hence, a momentum model that has worked well with a\\nholding period equal to a week in the backtest period may work only\\nwith a one-day holding period now. Worse, the whole strategy may\\nbecome unproﬁtable a year into the future. Also, using a backtest of\\nthe trading strategy to determine holding period can be fraught with\\ndata-snooping bias, since the number of historical trades may be\\nlimited. Unfortunately, for a momentum strategy where the trades\\nare triggered by news or events, there are no other alternatives. For\\na mean-reverting strategy, however, there is a more statistically ro-\\nbust way to determine the optimal holding period that does not de-\\npend on the limited number of actual trades.\\nThe mean reversion of a time series can be modeled by an\\nequation called the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck formula (Unlenbeck, 1930).\\nLet’s say we denote the mean-reverting spread (long market value'),\n",

However, rather than imposing an ar-\\nbitrary stop-loss price and thus introducing an extra adjustable pa-\\nrameter, which invites data-snooping bias, exiting based on the most\\nrecent entry signal is clearly justiﬁed based on the rationale for the\\nmomentum model.\\nConsider a parallel situation when we are running a reversal\\nmodel. If an existing position has incurred a loss, running the re-\\nversal model again will simply generate a new signal with the same\\nsign. Thus, a reversal model for entry signals will never recommend\\na stop loss. (On the contrary, it can recommend a target price or\\nproﬁt cap when the reversal has gone so far as to hit the opposite\\nentry threshold.) And, indeed, it is much more reasonable to exit\\na position recommended by a mean-reversal model based on hold-\\ning period or proﬁt cap than stop loss, as a stop loss in this case\\noften means you are exiting at the worst possible time.

These strategies have been applied to both equity and\\ncommodity futures markets. However, from my own experience,\\nmuch of the seasonality in equity markets has weakened or even\\ndisappeared in recent years, perhaps due to the widespread knowl-\\nedge of this trading opportunity, whereas some seasonal trades in\\ncommodity futures are still proﬁtable.\\nThe most famous seasonal trade in equities is called theJanuary\\neffect. There are actually many versions of this trade. One ver-\\nsion states that small-cap stocks that had the worst returns in the\\nprevious calendar year will have higher returns in January than\\nsmall-cap stocks that had the best returns (Singal, 2006). The ra-\\ntionale for this is that investors like to sell their losers in Decem-\\nber to beneﬁt from tax losses, which creates additional downward'),\n",

As usual, one way to\\nalleviate this problem is to try somewhat different entry and exit\\ndates to see if the proﬁtability holds up. In addition, one should\\nconsider only those trades where the seasonality makes some eco-\\nnomic sense. The gasoline and natural gas trades amply satisfy these\\ncriteria.\\nHIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nSTRATEGIES\\nIn general, if a high Sharpe ratio is the goal of your trading strategy\\n(as it should be, given what I said in Chapter 6), then you should be\\ntrading at high frequencies, rather than holding stocks overnight.\\nWhat are high-frequency trading strategies, and why do they\\nhave superior Sharpe ratios? Many experts in high-frequency trading\\nwould not regard any strategy that holds positions for more than a\\nfew seconds as high frequency, but here I would take a more pedes-\\ntrian approach and include any strategy that does not hold a po-\\nsition overnight. Many of the early high-frequency strategies were\\napplied to the foreign exchange market, and then later on to the fu-\\ntures market, because of their abundance of liquidity. In the last six\\nor seven years, however, with the increasing liquidity in the equity\\nmarket, the availability of historical tick database for stocks, and\\nmushrooming computing power, this type of strategies has become\\nwidespread for stock trading as well.\\nThe reason why these strategies have Sharpe ratio is simple:\\nBased on the “law of large numbers,” the more bets you can place,\\nthe smaller the percent deviation from the mean return you will\\nexperience. With high-frequency trading, one can potentially place\\nhundreds if not thousands of bets all in one day. Therefore, pro-\\nvided the strategy is sound and generates positive mean return, you\\ncan expect the day-to-day deviation from this return to be minimal.\\nWith this high Sharpe ratio, one can increase the leverage to a much'),\n",

In fact, it is impossible to explain in general why high-\\nfrequency strategies are often proﬁtable, as there are as many such\\nstrategies as there are fund managers. Some of them are mean re-\\nverting, while others are trend following. Some are market-neutral\\npair traders, while others are long-only directional traders. In gen-\\neral, though, these strategies aim to exploit tiny inefﬁciencies in\\nthe market or to provide temporary liquidity needs for a small fee.\\nUnlike betting on macroeconomic trends or company fundamentals\\nwhere the market environment can experience upheavals during the\\nlifetime of a trade, such inefﬁciencies and need for liquidity persist\\nday to day, allowing consistent daily proﬁts to be made. Further-\\nmore, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-\\nest sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for\\nhigh-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done\\nvery quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-\\ning and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The\\nworst that can happen as these strategies become more popular is a\\nslow death as a result of gradually diminishing returns. Sudden dras-\\ntic losses are not likely, nor are contagious losses across multiple\\naccounts.\\nThough successful high-frequency strategies have such numer-\\nous merits, it is not easy to backtest such strategies when the\\naverage holding period decreases to minutes or even seconds.\\nTransaction costs are of paramount importance in testing such\\nstrategies. Without incorporating transactions, the simplest strate-\\ngies may seem to work at high frequencies. As a consequence, just\\nhaving high-frequency data with last prices is not sufﬁcient—data\\nwith bid, ask, and last quotes is needed to ﬁnd out the proﬁtability\\nof executing on the bid versus the ask.

High-speed execution may account for a large part of the ac-\\ntual proﬁts or losses. Professional high-frequency trading ﬁrms have\\nbeen writing their strategies in C instead of other, more user-friendly\\nlanguages, and locating their servers next to the exchange or a ma-\\njor Internet backbone to reduce the microsecond delays. So even\\nthough the Sharpe ratio is appealing and the returns astronomical,\\ntruly high-frequency trading is not by any means easy for an inde-\\npendent trader to achieve in the beginning. But there is no reason\\nnot to work toward this goal gradually as expertise and resources\\naccrue.\\nIS IT BETTER TO HAVE\\nA HIGH-LEVERAGE VERSUS\\nAH I G H - B E T AP O R T F O L I O ?\\nIn Chapter 6, I discussed the optimal leverage to apply to a port-\\nfolio based on the Kelly formula. In the section on factor models\\nearlier in this chapter, I discussed the Fama-French Three-Factor\\nmodel, which suggests that return of a portfolio (or a stock) is\\nproportional to its beta (if we hold the market capitalization and\\nbook value of its stocks ﬁxed). In other words, you can increase\\nreturn on a portfolio by either increasing its leverage or increas-\\ning its beta (by selecting high-beta stocks.) Both ways seem com-\\nmonsensical. In fact, it is clear that given a low-beta portfolio and\\na high-beta portfolio, it is easy to apply a higher leverage on the\\nlow-beta portfolio so as to increase its beta to match that of the\\nhigh-beta portfolio. And assuming that the stocks of two portfo-\\nlios have the same average market capitalizations and book val-\\nues, the average returns of the two will also be the same (ignor-\\ning speciﬁc returns, which will decrease in importance as long as\\nwe increase the number stocks in the portfolios), according to the\\nFama-French model. So should we be indifferent to which portfolio\\nto own?\\nThe answer is no. Recall in Chapter 6 that the long-term com-\\npounded growth rate of a portfolio, if we use the Kelly leverage,'),\n",

So if the two hypothetical portfolios have the same average\\nreturn, then we would prefer the one that has the smaller risk or\\nstandard deviation. Empirical studies have found that a portfolio\\nthat consists of low-beta stocks generally has lower risk and thus\\na higher Sharpe ratio.\\nFor example, in a paper titled “Risk Parity Portfolios” (not pub-\\nlicly distributed), Dr. Edward Qian at PanAgora Asset Management\\nargued that a typical 60–40 asset allocation between stocks and\\nbonds is not optimal because it is overweighted with risky assets\\n(stocks in this case). Instead, to achieve a higher Sharpe ratio while\\nmaintaining the same risk level as the 60–40 portfolio, Dr. Qian rec-\\nommended a 23–77 allocation while leveraging the entire portfolio\\nby 1.8.\\nSomehow, the market is chronically underpricing high-beta\\nstocks. Hence, given a choice between a portfolio of high-beta\\nstocks and a portfolio of low-beta stocks, we should prefer the low-\\nbeta one, which we can then leverage up to achieve the maximum\\ncompounded growth rate.\\nThere is one usual caveat, however. All this is based on the Gaus-\\nsian assumption of return distributions. (See discussions in Chapter\\n6 on this issue.) Since the actual returns distributions have fat tails,\\none should be quite wary of using too much leverage on normally\\nlow-beta stocks.\\nSUMMARY\\nThis book has been largely about a particular type of quantitative\\ntrading called statistical arbitrage in the investment industry. De-\\nspite this fancy name, statistical arbitrage is actually far simpler\\nthan trading derivatives (e.g., options) or ﬁxed-income instruments,\\nboth conceptually and mathematically. I have described a large part\\nof the statistical arbitrageur’s standard arsenal: mean reversion and\\nmomentum, regime switching, stationarity and cointegration, arbi-\\ntrage pricing theory or factor model, seasonal trading models, and,\\nﬁnally, high-frequency trading.'),\n",

I ﬁgured that if I could not trade proﬁtably when I was free of\\nall institutional constraints and politics, then either trading is a hoax\\nor I am just not cut out to be a trader. Either way, I promised myself\\nthat in such an event I would quit trading forever. Fortunately, I sur-\\nvived. Along the way, I also found the key to that central mystery to\\nwhich I alluded earlier.\\nThe key, it turns out, iscapacity, a concept I introduced at the\\nend of Chapter 2. (To recap: Capacity is the amount of equity a strat-\\negy can generate good returns on.) It is far, far easier to generate\\na high Sharpe ratio trading a $100,000 account than a $100 million\\naccount. There are many simple and proﬁtable strategies that can\\nwork at the low capacity end that would be totally unsuitable to\\nhedge funds. This is the niche for independent traders like us.\\nLet me elaborate on this capacity issue. Most proﬁtable strate-\\ngies that have low capacities are acting as market makers: provid-\\ning short-term liquidity when it is needed and taking quick proﬁts\\nwhen the liquidity need disappears. If, however, you have billions\\nof dollars to manage, you now become the party in need of liquid-\\nity, and you have to pay for it. To minimize the cost of this liquidity\\ndemand, you necessarily have to hold your positions over long pe-\\nriods of time. When you hold for long periods, your portfolio will\\nbe subject to macroeconomic changes (i.e., regime shifts) that can\\ncause great damage to your portfolio. Though you may still be prof-\\nitable in the long run if your models are sound, you cannot avoid the\\noccasional sharp drawdowns that attract newspaper headlines.\\nOther disadvantages beset large-capacity strategies favored by\\nlarge institutions. The intense competition among hedge funds\\nmeans the strategies become less proﬁtable. The lowered returns\\nin turn pressure the fund manager to overleverage. To beat out the\\ncompetition, traders need to resort to more and more complicated\\nmodels, which in turn invite data-snooping bias. But despite the in-\\ncreasing complexity of the models, the fundamental market inefﬁ-\\nciency that they are trying to exploit may remain the same, and thus\\ntheir portfolios may still end up holding very similar positions. We\\ndiscussed this phenomenon in Chapter 6. When market environment'),\n",

For example, as a trader in a\\nquantitative fund, you may be prohibited from trading a long-only\\nstrategy, but long-only strategies are often easier to ﬁnd, simpler,\\nmore proﬁtable, and if traded in small sizes, no more risky than\\nmarket-neutral strategies. Or you may be prohibited from trading\\nfutures. You may be required to be not only market neutral but\\nalso sector neutral. You may be asked to ﬁnd a momentum strat-\\negy when you know that a mean-reverting strategy would work.\\nAnd on and on. Many of these constraints are imposed for risk\\nmanagement reasons, but many others may be just whims, quirks,\\nand prejudices of the management. As every student of mathe-\\nmatical optimization knows, any constraint imposed on an opti-\\nmization problem decreases the optimal objective value. Similarly,\\nevery institutional constraint imposed on a trading strategy tends to\\ndecrease its returns, if not its Sharpe ratio as well. Finally, some\\nsenior managers who oversee frontline portfolio managers of quan-\\ntitative funds are actually not well versed in quantitative techniques,\\nand they tend to make decisions based on anything but quantitative\\ntheories.\\nWhen your strategy shows initial proﬁts, these managers may\\nimpose enormous pressure for you to scale up quickly, and when\\nyour strategy starts to lose, they may force you to liquidate the port-\\nfolios and abandon the strategy immediately. None of these inter-\\nferences in the quantitative investment process is mathematically\\noptimal.\\nBesides, such managers often have a mercurial temper, which\\nseldom mixes well with quantitative investment management. When\\nloss of money occurs, rationality is often the ﬁrst victim.\\nAs an independent trader, you are free from such constraints\\nand interferences, and as long as you are emotionally capable to\\nadhere to the discipline of quantitative trading, your trading envi-\\nronment may actually be closer to the optimal than that of a large\\nfund.'),\n",

Where do you go from here?\\nHow do yougrow?\\nActually, I discussed growth in Chapter 6, but in a limited sense.\\nUsing the Kelly formula, you can indeed achieve exponential growth\\nof your equity, but only up to the total capacity of your strategies. Af-\\nter that, the source of growth has to come from increasing the num-\\nber of strategies. You can, for example, look for strategies that trade\\nat higher frequencies than the ones you currently have. To do that,\\nyou have to invest and upgrade your technological infrastructure,\\nand purchase expensive high-frequency historical data. Or, con-\\nversely, you can look for strategies that hold longer periods. Despite\\ntheir typically lower Sharpe ratios, they do enormously improve\\nyour capacity. For many of these strategies, you probably have to\\ninvest in expensive historical fundamental data for your backtest.\\nIf you are an equity trader, you can branch out into futures or\\ncurrencies, which typically have higher capacities than equity mod-\\nels. If you run out of ideas or lack expertise in a new market that you\\nwant to enter, you can form collaborations with other like-minded\\ntraders, or you can hire consultants to help with the research. If you\\nare running too many strategies to manage manually on your own,\\nyou can push your automation further so that there is no need for\\nyou to manually intervene in the daily trading unless exceptions or\\nproblems occur. Of course, you can also hire a trader to monitor all\\nthese strategies for you.\\nThese investments in data, infrastructure, and personnel are all\\npart of reinvesting some of your earnings to further the growth of\\nyour trading business, not unlike growing any other type of busi-\\nness.

Once you have\\nautomated everything and your equity is growing exponentially, can\\nyou just sit back, relax, and enjoy your wealth? Unfortunately, ex-\\nperience tells us that strategies do lose their potency over time as\\nmore traders catch on to them. It takes ongoing research to supply\\nyou with new strategies.\\nThere are always upheavals and major regime changes that may\\noccur once every decade but will nevertheless cause sudden deaths\\nto certain strategies. As with any commercial endeavor, a period of\\nrapid growth will inevitably be followed by the steady if unspectac-\\nular returns of a mature business.

(Many of\\nthe ﬁgures and charts in this book are created using MATLAB.) Fi-\\nnally, MATLAB codes can be compiled into C or C++ executables\\nthat can run on computers without the MATLAB platform installed.\\nIn fact, there is third-party software that can convert MATLAB code\\ninto C source codes, too.\\nThe basic syntax of MATLAB is very similar to Visual Basic or C.\\nFor example, we can initialize the elements of an array x like this:\\nx(1)=0.1;\\nx(2)=0.3;\\n% 3 elements of an array initialized.\\n% This is by default a row-vector\\nx(3)=0.2;\\nNote that we don’t need to ﬁrst “declare” this array, nor do we\\nneed to tell MATLAB its expected size beforehand. If you leave out\\nthe “;” sign, MATLAB will print out the result of the content of the\\nvariable being assigned a value. Any comments can be written after\\nthe “%” sign. If you wish, you can initialize a large number of ele-\\nments en masse to a common value:\\n% assigning the value 0.8 to all elements of a 3-vector y.\\nThis is a row-vector.y=0.8*ones(1, 3)\\nNow if you want to do a vector addition of the two vectors, you\\ncan do it the old-fashioned way (just as you would in C), that is,\\nusing a loop:\\nfor i=1:3\\nz(i)=x(i)+y(i) % z is [0.9 1.1 1]\\nend\\nBut the power of MATLAB is that it can handle many array oper-\\nations in parallel very succinctly, without using loops.

While \\ninstitutional traders continue to implement this highly \\neffective approach, many independent traders—with \\nlimited resources and less computing power—have \\nwondered if they can still challenge powerful industry \\nprofessionals at their own game? The answer is “yes,” \\nand in Quantitative Trading, author Dr. Ernest Chan, \\na respected independent trader and consultant, will \\nshow you how.\\nWhether you’re an independent “retail” trader looking \\nto start your own quantitative trading business or an \\nindividual who aspires to work as a quantitative \\ntrader at a major ﬁ nancial institution, this practical \\nguide contains the information you need to succeed.\\nOrganized around the steps you should take to start \\ntrading quantitatively, this book skillfully addresses \\nhow to:\\n\\x7f Find a viable trading strategy that you’re both comfortable \\nwi\\nth and confident in\\n\\x7f Backtest your strategy—with MATLAB ®, Excel, and other \\nplatforms—to ensure good historical performance\\n\\x7f Build and implement an automated trading system to \\nex\\necute your strategy\\n\\x7f Scale up or wind down your strategies depending on their \\nre\\nal-world profitability\\n\\x7f Manage the money and risks involved in holding positions \\ngenerated by\\n your strategy\\n\\x7f Incorporate advanced concepts that most professionals use \\nin\\nto your everyday trading activities\\n\\x7f And much more\\nWhi\\nle Dr. Chan takes the time to outline the essential \\naspects of turning quantitative trading strategies \\ninto proﬁ ts, he doesn’t get into overly theoretical \\nor sophisticated theories. Instead, he highlights the \\nsimple tools and techniques you can use to gain a \\nmuch-needed edge over today’s institutional traders.\\nAnd for those who want to keep up with the \\nlatest news, ideas, and trends in quantitative \\ntrading, you’re welcome to visit Dr. Chan’s blog, \\nepchan.blogspot.com, as well as his premium \\ncontent Web site, epchan.com/subscriptions, \\nwhich you’ll have free access to with purchase of \\nthis book.\\nAs an independent trader, you’re free from the con-\\nstraints found in today’s institutional environment—\\nand as long as you adhere to the discipline of \\nquantitative trading, you can achieve signiﬁ cant \\nr e t u r n s .  W i t h  t h i s  r e l i a b l e  r e s o u r c e  a s  y o u r  g u i d e ,  \\nyou’ll quickly discover what it takes to make it in such \\na dynamic and demanding ﬁ eld.\\n(CONTINUED FROM FRONT FLAP)\\n(CONTINUED ON BACK FLAP)\\nPraise for  Quantitative Trading\\n“As technology has evolved, so has the ease in developing trading strategies.

Ernie’s extensive hands-on experience in building trading systems is invaluable for \\naspiring traders who wish to take their knowledge to the next level.”\\n— RAMON CUMMINS, private investor\\n“Out of the many books and articles on quantitative trading that I’ve read over the years, very few have \\nbe\\nen of much use at all. In most instances, the authors have no real knowledge of the subject matter, or do \\nhave something important to say but are unwilling to do so because of fears of having trade secrets stolen. \\nErnie subscribes to a different credo: Share meaningful information and have meaningful interactions \\nwith the quantitative community at large.
